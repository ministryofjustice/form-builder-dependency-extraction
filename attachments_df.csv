(the tariff levels are set out in full at the end of this guide); or(e)a dependant or relative of a victim of a crime of violence who has since died (see part 4.16- 4.19 of this guide).2.4 unless there are good reasons you should also:-(a)have reported the incident personally to the police as soon as possible after it happened (butsee also part 8 of this guide);(b)send your application so that we receive it within 2 years from the date of the incidentcausing the injury (but see also part 7.2 -

7.5of this guide).3.5permission forenquiries - we need your permission to approach the police, hospital, doctor, youremployer or anyone else who can help to verify your claim. there is a place on the application formfor you to sign to allow us to make these enquiries, which are dealt with in strict confidence.3.6photographs - please do not send photographs of your injury unless we ask you to.applications on behalf of children3.7if the application is in respect of child abuse, ask us for the separate leaflet child abuse and thecriminal injuries compensation scheme. more generally, if you are applying on behalf ofsomeone under the age of 18 you must be an adult with parental responsibility for the child (ie, thenatural parent, adoptive parent or another person with legal parental responsibility). acopy of thechilds birth certificate mustbe enclosed with the application form. if the child is in care we willexpect the application to be made by the local authority if they have assumed parentalresponsibility.the application will then be signed by a responsible officer on the local authoritysbehalf. in other cases we will expect the application to be made and signed by the person havingparental responsibility for the child for the time being.43.8where there is no one legally entitled to act for the child, help should be sought from the officialsolicitor for an application in england and wales; but in the case of an application arising inscotland we may require the appointment of a tutor or guardian. we do not make these arrangementsourselves. wherever possible all necessary formalities should be completed on the childs behalfbefore an application is made so that delays do not occur at later stages. if the incident for which theclaim is made occurred some time ago, you should not delay the application but send it to us asquickly as possible.3.9if you are unsure about parental responsibility you should seek advice, for example from your localcitizensadvice bureau.adults unable to manage their own affairs3.10if you are applying on behalf of an adult who is legally incapable of managing his/her own affairs,you must be properly authorised to do so. provided that we consider you to be a suitable person wemay appoint you to act as the applicants representative for the purpose of the scheme. this willenable you to authorise all our enquiries and to decide on the applicants behalf whether to acceptthe award, to ask for a review or to appeal to the criminal injuries compensation appeals panel.before we take this step we will require medical evidence that the applicant is incapable by reasonsof mental disorder as defined in the mental health act of 1983 of managing and administeringhis/her property and affairs.part 4 - howwe dealwith your applicationacknowledgement and enquiries4.1we will acknowledge your application and give you a personal reference number which will help usto identify it quickly should you need to contact us.4.2we will then normally make enquiries of the police, medical authorities and other relevant bodies toenable your claim to be assessed.4.3it is important that you give all reasonable help to us in connection with your application(paragraph 13(c)).assessment of yourapplication4.4claims officers in the authority are responsible for deciding in accordance with the scheme whatawards (if any) should be made in individual cases, and how they should be paid.4.5as soon as we have the information we need, we will first decide whether your application isacceptable within the rules in paragraphs 6 to 12, and 38(fatal cases) of the scheme. these areexplained in some detail in parts 7-9of this guide but, amongst other factors, we will need toconsider whether an award should be withheld or reduced under any of the provisions ofparagraphs 13 to 16.personal injury4.6if your application is acceptable we will assess whether or not your injury is serious enough toqualify for at least the minimum award payable under the tariff(paragraph 25, note 1 on thetariff of awards; see also part 7.6of this guide).4.7we will then identify the tariff level into which your injury falls (paragraphs 25 to 29 and tariffof awards). to help us do that, we may ask you to attend a centre as near as possible 5to your home to have the injury examined by a doctor nominated by us (paragraph 20). we willpay reasonable travelling expenses for this purpose (covering, where appropriate, both your and acarers expenses).4.8where you suffer more than one qualifying injury, the tariff award will be that for the highest ratedinjury plus, where the other injuries are separate from the highest rated injury and from one another,10% of the tariff value of the second most serious injury and, where appropriate, 5% of the tariffvalue of the third most serious injury.this means, for example, that where the injuries are adepressed fracture of the skull (single tariff payment 6000), loss of 2 front teeth (2000) and abroken nose (1500), the combined award would be 6000 + 200 + 75 totalling 6275.4.9the tariff includes an element of compensation for the degree of shock which an applicant innormal circumstances would experience as a result of an incident resulting in injury. if the shock (asdefined in note 2 in the tariff of awards) is such that it would attract an award from a higher tarifflevel than the injury itself, then the award for shock will be paid rather than the award for injury.4.10an award will be reduced by the full amount of any payment of compensation or damages received in respect of the same injuries (paragraph 48).4.11if we make an award and you subsequently receive compensation or damages as described inparagraph 48of the scheme you will be required to pay to us the full amount of the other paymentup to the level of our award of compensation.compensation for loss of earnings (paragraphs 30-34)4.12if your injury has caused you to lose or is likely to cause you to lose earnings or earning capacity forlonger than 28 full weeks you may be eligible for additional compensation for this loss. if so, wewill ask you for details of your loss and send you a separate guide on how it is calculated.4.13please note that compensation is notpayable forthe first 28 full weeks of lost earnings orearning capacity.compensation for special expenses (paragraphs 35-36)4.14you may be considered for an additional amount of compensation if, as a direct result of the injuryyou have been incapacitated or are likely to be incapacitated for longer than 28 full weeks and haveincurred special expenses for medical/dental/optical treatment, related equipment and care. you donot have to be employed to be considered for compensation for special expenses which, providedyou meet the time condition, are payable from the date of the injury.we will ask you for details,sending you a separate guide.4.15if, after completing the personal injury application form, your circumstances change and you thinkyou may be eligible within the terms of the scheme to apply for additional compensation for loss ofearnings and/or special expenses you should write to this address quoting your reference number andgiving details of the change in your circumstances.fatal cases (paragraphs 37-44)4.16those eligible to applyare dependants or relatives (as shown in the next paragraph) of someonewho died as a result of a criminal injury, or who was criminally injured but died from some othercause.64.17 adependant or relative is someone who at the time of the deceaseds death was the deceaseds:-(a) husband or wife(b) unmarried but long term partner (of the opposite sex)(c)parent(d) *childor(e)former husband or wife who was financially supported by the deceased.* childmeans a person of any age - the definition isnotrestricted to a person below the age of 18.death as a result of a criminal injury4.18if you fall into any category at section 4.17 and the deceased died as a result of the criminal injury,we will assess your eligibility for compensation in the form of a fatal injury award and/or adependency award and/or an award for loss of parental services (paragraphs 38-42).applicationmay be made even if an award had been made to the victim for the injury before death (paragraph43).death following, but not as a result of a criminal injury4.19where the victim has died but the death was not as a result of the criminal injury you may beeligible to apply for supplementary compensation (paragraph 44). supplementary compensation isintended to cover loss of earnings, expenses and liabilities incurred by the victim before death as aresult of the crime of violence. payment of a tariff injury award cannot be made.general eligibility4.20consideration of applications for compensation in respect of fatal cases are subject to the maineligibility requirements of the scheme and apply to the applicant and the deceased (paragraphs 13and 14).funeral expenses4.21where the victim dies as a result of a criminal injury, an application will be considered forreimbursement of reasonable funeral expenses, even where the person bearing the cost of the funeralis otherwise ineligible to claim under the scheme (paragraph 37). in calculating the expenses to bereimbursed we will take account of the religious and cultural background of the victim and hisfamily.notification of our decision4.22you will be told of our decision in writing and, in cases where an award has been reduced orwithheld, you will be given reasons. any award made by us may be subject to directions andarrangements considered by us to be appropriate, taking into account the circumstances of the case(paragraph 50).7payment4.23wherever possible we will try to resolve your application by a single payment of compensation (afinal award) but to do this the medical situation needs to be clear. however, in some cases there canbe a delay and if, in all respects, you are eligible for compensation, we may make one or moreinterim awards on account (paragraph 51).we have discretion to reconsider a decision to make afinal award at any time before it is actually paid (paragraph 53).annuities4.24where it is likely that a high value award will be made, you may opt for payment through thepurchase of an annuity or annuities. these can provide index linked, tax-free payments. we will takeyou or your representativesinstructions as to which annuity to purchase. any expenses incurred willbe met from the award. (paragraph 52).reopening of cases (paragraphs 56-57)4.25we have discretion to re-open a case after a final decision has been made if the medical conditioncaused by the injury has deteriorated to such an extent that an injustice would occur if the originalcompensation assessment were allowed to stand. the following are examples of circumstances inwhich we may re-open a case:-where the injuries are now serious enough to qualify for an award; where the applicant would now qualify for an award from a higher injury band;where the applicants medical condition has deteriorated to such an extent that he/she is nolonger able to pursue his/her occupation.if any of these factors apply you should write to us asking for the case to be re-opened. you mustsupply medical evidence to support this application. if the application is made more than 2 yearsafter the date of the final decision we can only consider re-opening it if we are satisfied that it wouldnot involve us in extensive enquiries.part 5 - review of decisions (paragraphs 58-60)5.1if you consider that you have grounds to disagree with our decision you may apply for it to bereviewed. if you decide to do this you should apply in writing within 90 days from the date on ourletter giving you notice of our original decision, giving your reasons. your case will then beconsidered afresh by a claims officer more senior than the one who made the original decision. botheligibility for and the amount of any award will be reviewed and a fresh decision, with reasons, willbe sent to you. on review of the decision a claims officer may increase, reduce or withhold anaward.5.2we will send you an application forreview and a guide to review procedures when we issueour original decision.part 6 - appeals tothe criminal injuries compensation appeals panel(paragraphs 62-82)6.1if you consider that there are grounds for contesting the result of the review you may appeal, within30 days from the date on our letter giving you notice of our reviewed decision, to the criminalinjuries compensation appeals panel. the members and staff of this panel are entirely independent8from the authority and have wide powers within the terms of the scheme to consider afresh youroriginal application and any further information you wish to provide. on consideration of an appealthe panel may increase, reduce or withhold an award. adecision made by the panel, whether at anoral hearing of your case or otherwise, is final.6.2we will send you an application forappealand a guide to appeal procedures when we issueour reviewed decision.part 7 - further information on the scope ofthe schemewhere did the incident happen?7.1the injury must have been sustained in great britain or one of the other places set out in paragraph8of the scheme. injuries sustained elsewhere, for example on holiday abroad, are not eligiblealthough there could be a remedy under a similar scheme in force in the country concerned. if theinjury was sustained in northern ireland you are not eligible to apply under this scheme. northernireland has its own scheme and you should seek details from:-the compensation agency royston house34 upper queen street belfastbt1 6fdtime limit7.2do not delay in making your application which should be made within 2yearsof the date of theincident giving rise to the injury.we will not consider applications outside this period unless it isconsidered that in the particular circumstances of the case it is reasonable and in the interests ofjustice to do so.7.3the 2 year time limit is necessary because of the difficulties involved in investigating andsubstantiating late claims as we are often unable to obtain reliable evidence of police involvementand medical treatment given at the time because records are no longer available.7.4we will sympathetically consider late applications from and on behalf of victims whose ability tohelp themselves is or was impaired and from those who were under the age of 18 at the time of theincident, provided the application is received within reasonable time of the victim reaching 18.7.5we will also give careful consideration to your application if your injuries only become apparentsome time after the incident which caused them, provided the application is made as soon aspossible after discovering the cause and we can investigate and verify the details of the incident.criminal (personal) injury7.6to qualify for an award of compensation you must have suffered a physical and/or mental injury,sufficiently serious to be classified in one of the tariff bands attached to the scheme. minor injuriessuch as scratches or bruises alone will not qualify for an award but, if you have suffered acombination of minor injuries (as shown in note 1in the tariff of awards) which caused you tovisit your doctor for treatment at least twice and from which you did not recover for at least 6weeks, you may qualify.97.7to qualify for an award in respect of mental injury alone, we must be satisfied that you were put inreasonable fear of immediate physical harm to yourself, or you either witnessed or were closelyinvolved in the immediate aftermath of an incident where a person with whom you had a closerelationship of love and affection was physically injured (paragraph 9).directly attributable7.8you will only be compensated for injuries directly resulting from a crime of violence or threat ofviolence. this means that we must satisfy ourselves, on the basis of all the available facts, that notonly was the incident in which you were injured a crime of violence, but also that the incident wasthe substantial cause of your injury.you will not, however, qualify for an award if your only injuryis shock resulting from the loss of possessions following a crime which did not involve personalviolence.crime of violence7.9there is no legal definition of the term but crimes of violence usually involve a physical attack onthe person, for example assaults, wounding and sexual offences. this is not always so, however, andwe judge every case on the basis of its circumstances. for example the threat of violence may, insome circumstances, be considered a crime of violence.7.10you may be eligible for compensation even if the injuries were caused by someone who could not beheld responsible under criminal law, for example, because they were too young or insane(paragraph 10).7.11the following types of incident may in certain circumstances be regarded as crimes of violence forthe purpose of the scheme.trespass on a railway7.12if you were employed by a railway company and were present and saw another person injured orkilled as a result of trespassing on the railway you may be entitled to compensation for the shockyou suffered. you may also be entitled if you discovered a body on or beside the track or wereinvolved in the immediate aftermath of the incident. you should, however, note that to receive anaward the shock must be sufficiently serious to qualify under one of the tariff levels listed or at leastthe lowest tariff level.accidental injury7.13as a general rule, you will not be entitled to compensation if you were injured accidentally.thereare some exceptions. if your injuries were sustained as a result of your involvement (whetherintentional or not) in the prevention of an offence you may be eligible. please read prevention of anoffence andexceptional risk.prevention of an offence7.14if you were injured whilst you yourself were attempting to catch an offender, a suspected offender orhelping a police officer to catch an offender, you may be entitled to an award (see also exceptionalriskand accidental injury). you may also be entitled to an award if you were injured during thecourse of such an action even though you were not yourself taking part in it. if you were, forexample, an innocent bystander and were knocked over and injured by the offender or the pursuer,you could be entitled to an award. these conditions apply even if the suspected offence was not acrime of violence.10arson7.15if you have suffered an injury as a direct result of a crime of arson, you may be entitled to an award.if you were accidentally injured whilst fighting a fire resulting from an arson attack, or remedyingthe consequences of such an attack, you may qualify if you were taking an exceptional risk. if youare a fire fighter attending a fire resulting from an arson attack and you trip over a hose, you areunlikely to be compensated. but if, for example, your injuries are sustained in hazardouscircumstances inside a burning building, this may be considered to be an exceptional risk.exceptional risk7.16in assessing whether or not you were taking an exceptional risk, we will look at all the facts todecide whether the risk you took was exceptional and justified in all the circumstances. in generalterms, if you are a police officer who had tripped in the street in broad daylight when running toapprehend an offender you are unlikely to be compensated. similarly climbing over a wall or a fencewould not usually be considered an exceptional risk. however, an action which we would notconsider to be an exceptional risk in daylight might be so in darkness.7.17if you are an ordinary member of the public who was injured in similar circumstances whilstattempting to apprehend an offender or assisting a police officer we may, however, take a differentview. police officers, or, for example, firefighters because of their training and experience should bein a better position to assess the consequences of their actions and we believe that it would be unjustto apply the same tests to civilians. police officers injured in traffic accidents occurring during thecourse of car chases are not normally considered to be eligible for compensation unless there wassome exceptionally risky additional factor, such as severe adverse weather conditions.poisoning7.18if you have suffered an injury as a direct result of a crime of poisoning, you may be entitled to anaward.injuries caused by animals7.19this type of injury often results from an attack by a dog, but whilst such attacks can be savage andvery distressing, we have to be satisfied that the attack amounted to a crime of violence before wecan consider making an award.7.20there are generally 2 main circumstances in which we would consider making an award:-(a)if the person in charge of the dog deliberately set it on you.(b)if the attack was a result of the dog owners failure to control an animal which was known tobe vicious and the lack of control could be shown to amount to recklessness. if, for example,a dog with a previous history of vicious behaviour was allowed out without adequaterestraint or in the charge of a child, this might amount to recklessness.injuries caused by motorvehicles7 . 2 1if your injuries were caused by a motor vehicle we can only award compensation if the vehicle was ine ffect used as a weapon. we have to be satisfied that the driver of the vehicle deliberately drove it atyou in an attempt to cause you injury. the general rule is that compensation is not payable under the11scheme for injuries caused as the result of traffic offences on a public highway. in such cases, yourremedy is through the drivers insurance company or, if the driver was uninsured or unidentified,through the motor insurersbureau (mib). the address of the motor insurersbureau is:-152 silbury boulevard central milton keynes mk9 1nbchildren playing dangerous games7 . 2 2these cases present 2 problems. we must first of all be satisfied that a crime of violence has beencommitted and the fact that a game was dangerous will not in itself be sufficient. secondly, even if acrime of violence is established, we will not make an award where there is little to choose betweenthe conduct of the child who inflicted the injury and the victim. to do so would merely becompensating the loser. in a case, for example, where 11 and 12 year old boys fired stones fromcatapults at each other, and one boy received a serious eye injury, this would technically be an assaultand therefore a crime of violence. the application would, however, be rejected. in cases where thechildren are of different age groups or take unequal parts in the game, a full or reduced award may bemade depending on the degree of participation and understanding of the risks involved.part 8 - eligibilityto receive compensation (paragraph 13)8.1payment of compensation for injury as a result of a crime of violence is intended to be an expressionof public sympathy and support for innocent victims. the original scheme, introduced in 1964,envisaged that it would be inappropriate for those with significant criminal records or those whoseown conduct led to their being injured, to receive compensation from public funds. it was also feltthat people who failed to co-operate in bringing the offender to justice should not benefit from suchpayments. these provisions continue in this scheme.8.2accordingly, we have the discretion to withhold or reduce an award which might otherwise begranted if one or more of the reasons which are set out in paragraph 13of the scheme apply toyour claim.informing the police (paragraph 13(a))8.3it is not necessary for an offender to have been convicted before an award can be made. someoffenders are never found. however, we attach great importance to the duty of every victim of crimeto inform the police of all the circumstances without delay and to co-operate with their enquiries andany subsequent prosecution.8.4it is particularly important that the incident should have been reported since it is our main safeguardagainst fraud. if you have not reported the circumstances of the injury to the police, and can offer noreasonable explanation for not doing so, you should assume that any application for compensationwill be rejected. failure to inform the police is unlikely to be excused on the grounds that you fearedreprisals, or did not recognise your assailant, or saw no point in reporting it. reporting suchincidents can help the police prevent further offences against others.8.5it is for you to report the incident personally unless you are prevented from doing so because of thenature of your injuries. in this case it is then your duty to contact the police as soon as possible and co-operate with their enquiries. it is not sufficient to assume that the incident will havebeen reported by someone else because, even if it has, that person may not have known the fullcircumstances. reports by friends, relatives or workmates will not be sufficient unless there was agood reason for your not informing the police as well.128.6you must report all the relevant circumstances. if you deliberately leave out any importantinformation or otherwise mislead the police, an application for compensation will normally berejected.8.7you should report to the police at the earliest possible opportunity.failure to inform thempromptly can make further enquiries very difficult to pursue. every case is nevertheless treated on itsmerits and we will take a sympathetic view where the delay in reporting the incident to the police isclearly attributable to youth, old age, or to some physical or mental incapacity or psychologicaleffects of the crime. the requirement may also be waived if, for example, you were unaware thatyour injury was due to a crime of violence, or only discovered there was a connection long after theevent.8.8if, however, you fail to report immediately and only do so later just to make a claim forcompensation, your application is likely to be rejected.informing other organisations or someone else in authority8.9crimes of violence must be reported to the police. we will not normally accept reports made forexample to employers, trade union officials or social workers as sufficient. exceptions may bemade, however, in the case of injuries sustained, for example, in mental hospitals and prisons wherea prompt report to the appropriate person in authority represents a willingness that the matter shouldbe formally investigated. the appropriate authority in the case of a child will often be the childsparents, whose failure to inform the police will not prevent the childs claim from proceeding if itwould have been unreasonable to expect the child to take the matter any further. it should, however,be borne in mind that to consider any application we need to be able to investigate and substantiateany incident giving rise to a claim for compensation. therefore if an incident involving a child is notreported by a parent/guardian to someone in authority it is unlikely the application will succeed.there may be cases involving children where it might not necessarily be appropriate to involve thepolice. relatively minor incidents at school are examples of this. it might be in the best interest ofthe child in such cases for disciplinary action to be taken within the school and, in that type of case,we would accept a report to the school authorities as satisfactory.helping the police to prosecute (paragraph 13(b))8.10if the incident has been promptly reported to the police we have discretion to reduce or withholdcompensation if you subsequently fail to co-operate in bringing the offender to justice.8.11we make a distinction between 2 situations:-(a)where you refuse to co-operate with the police by, for example, refusing to make astatement, attend court, or make a statement which you later withdraw, we will normallymake no award.(b)where you were willing to co-operate but in the particular circumstances, it was decided bythe police or the prosecuting authority that no further action should be taken or prosecutionbrought, an award may be made, assuming that no other issues of eligibility are in question.8.12as with non-reporting, fear of reprisals will not generally be an excuse. if you at first refused to co-operate with the police but subsequently changed your mind and assisted them in all respects thenwe may consider whether a reduction of the award in respect of the initial failure or refusal to co-operate is appropriate.13failure to co-operate with the cica (paragraph 13(c))8.13we may withhold or reduce payment of an award if you persistently fail to comply with requests forinformation or otherwise fail to give all reasonable assistance to us or any other relevant authority inconnection with your application. this will include failure to attend medical examinations orinspections necessary to help us to reach a decision in your case.conduct before, during orafter the event (paragraph 13(d))8.14in this context conductmeans something which can fairly be described as bad conduct ormisconduct and includes provocative behaviour and offensive language. examples of the kind ofconduct that we can take into consideration are shown below.fighting/provocationan award may be reduced or withheld in the following circumstances:-(a)if your injury was caused in a fight in which you had voluntarily agreed to take part. this isso even if the consequences of such an agreement go far beyond what you expected. if youinvited someone outsidefor a fist-fight, we will not usually award compensation even ifyou ended up with the most serious injury.the fact that the offender went further and used aweapon will not normally make a difference.(b)if without reasonable cause you struck the first blow, regardless of the degree of retaliationor the consequence.(c)if the incident in which you were injured formed part of a pattern of violence in which youwere a voluntary participant; for example, if there was a history of assaults involving bothparties where you had previously been the assailant.(d)where you were injured whilst attempting to obtain revenge against the assailant.(e)if you used offensive language or behaved in an aggressive or threatening manner which ledto the attack which caused your injuries.criminal convictions (paragraph 13(e))8.15paragraph 13(e) of the scheme provides that an award may be withheld or reduced on account of anapplicants character as shown by his criminal convictions (excluding convictions which are spent).this is because a person who has committed criminal offences has probably caused distress and lossand injury to other persons, and has certainly caused considerable expense to society by reason ofcourt appearances and the cost of supervising sentences, even when they have been non-custodial,and the victims may themselves have sought compensation, which is another charge on society. eventhough an applicant may be blameless in the incident in which the injury was sustained, parliamenthas nevertheless provided in the scheme that convictions which are not spent under therehabilitation of offenders act 1974 should be taken into account.8.16the scale of penalty points listed opposite is an indicator of the extent to which any unspentconvictions may count against an award. these points, which are based on the type and/or length ofsentence imposed by the courts together with the time between the date of the sentence and receiptof the claim, are a guide to the gravity of an offence in relation to a claim. any sentence imposedafter the claim has been received will also be taken into account.14sentenceperiod between date of sentencepenalty of the courtand receipt of application by cica*points1imprisonmenta)period of sentence or less10 for more

at any stage whether on decisions made by the authorityor a determination made by the criminal injuries compensation appeals panel. it is intended toprovide a readily understood guide to the relative significance of the claimants criminal record. theconvictions recorded in any individual case and the points attributable to them will be assessedwithin the context of the particular circumstances of the claim and other related factors. forexample, a points total which indicates a reduction or refusal of an award may be mitigated wherethe injury resulted from the applicants assistance to the police in upholding the law or fromgenuinely helping someone under attack. or there may be evidence of rehabilitation not otherwiseindicated by the points system which may be taken into account. conversely, a low points score isno guarantee that an award will be made where, for example, the record contains offences ofviolence or sexual offencespart 9 - violence, including sexual offences, within the familygeneral9.1it is a general condition of the scheme that any person who causes an injury (whether or not thevictim is a member of the same family) must not benefit from an award payable to the victim(paragraph 15(a)).9.2we also need to be satisfied in all cases where the application is made by or on behalf of a child that it would not be against the childs interest to make an award (paragraph 15(b)).anexample might be that a child who was very young at the time of a very minor assault, who could reasonably be expected to make a full recovery and forget that it had happened. that might bea better outcome than if we made an award, invested it on the childs behalf and released it to him or her at age 18 which might well re-open the incident in the young persons mindand cause considerable distress.9.3those considerations, while they apply to all cases, are particularly relevant to the situation wherethe victim and the offender were living in the same household as members of the same family(paragraph 16).adults9.4if you and the person who injured you were living in the same household at the time of the incident,we will not award compensation unless:-(a)the person who injured you has been prosecuted (unless there are good reasons why thiscould not happen); and(b)you and the person who injured you have permanently stopped living together.aman and woman living together as husband and wife, even if they are not married, are treated asmembers of the same family.children9.5if it was a child who was injured, condition (b) above does not apply but, as explained at 9.1 and 9.2above, we must be satisfied that the offender does not benefit, and that it would not be against thechilds interest to make an award. ask for the separate leaflet child abuse and the criminalinjuries compensation scheme.16part 10 - what standards of service can you expectto receive fromthe cica?10.1you can expect us to deal with your application courteously and confidentially, and to write to youwith our decision as quickly as the time taken by other organisations to reply to our enquiries allows.10.2in particular, it is our aim:-(a)to acknowledge your application and send out all routine enquiry forms to the police andmedical authorities within 2 weeks of receipt.(b)once we have received a response to all our enquiries, to make and issue a decision within 4weeks.(c)if you decide to ask for a review of our decision, to acknowledge your application for reviewwithin 2 weeks of receipt.(d)to review your case, make a decision and notify you of that decision within 4 weeks

introduction1.1the criminal injuries compensation scheme applies to all applications received by the criminalinjuries compensation authority (cica) on or after 1 april 1996.1.2the purpose of this guide is to explain the main provisions of the scheme and to give youinformation about how the scheme works. this should help you to apply for compensation with aslittle trouble as possible. the guide is not, however, a substitute for the scheme itself and cannotcover every situation.1.3you do not need legal advice or representation in order to apply for compensation. if you do decideto seek legal or other advice to help you make your application, we cannot pay the costs of theseservices. if, however, you feel you need assistance with an application under the scheme, advice canbe obtained from your local citizens advice bureau or law centre. if you are a member of a tradeunion they may also help you. victim support can also help you complete your application butcannot offer you legal advice.1.4throughout the guide, references are made to paragraphsof the scheme. if you do not have a copyof the scheme itself, you can send for one and for any further forms or information you may requireto:-the criminal injuries compensation authority tay house300 bath streetglasgowg2 4jrtelephone no: 0141 331 2726fax no: 0141 331 2287part 2 - should you apply for compensation?2.1the main rules of the scheme are listed below.the list does not, however, cover all thecircumstances that can arise, and you should read or seek advice on the sections of the guide andthe scheme which you think are relevant to your situation.2.2we are unable to consider your application under this scheme if:(a)you were injured before 1 august 1964;(b)you have already applied for compensation in respect of the same criminal injury under anyscheme operating in great britain before 1 april 1996 (paragraph 7a);(c)the injury happened before 1 october 1979 and you and the person who injured you were living together as members of the same family (paragraph 7(b)).2.3for your application to be considered you must have been:-(a)a victim of a crime of violence, or injured in some other way covered by the scheme (seepart 8 of this guide);(b)physically and/or mentally injured as a result; 3(c)in england, scotland or wales at the time when the injury was sustained; and(d)injured seriously enough to qualify for at least the minimum award available under the scheme. (the tariff levels are set out in full at the end of this guide); or(e)a dependant or relative of a victim of a crime of violence who has since died (see part 4.16- 4.19 of this guide).2.4 unless there are good reasons you should also:-(a)have reported the incident personally to the police as soon as possible after it happened (butsee also part 8 of this guide);(b)send your application so that we receive it within 2 years from the date of the incidentcausing the injury (but see also part 7.2 - 7.5 of this guide).part 3 - howand when toapply3.1application forms and related guides are obtainable from our office at the address at the beginningof this guide.3.2personal injury-if you have been injured, please ask for and complete apersonal injuryapplication form.3.3fatal injury- if you intend to apply following the death of a victim of a crime of violence, pleaseask for and complete a fatal injuryapplication form.3.4time limit- completed applications should be sent to us as soon as possible, and must be receivedat our office no later than 2yearsafter the incident for which a claim is made (paragraph 17).this time limit may, however, be waived if we consider that there is a good reason for the delay andit is in the interests of justice to do so. for an application to proceed there must be enoughinformation still available for us to assess your claim (see also parts 7.2 - 7.5of this guide).3.5permission forenquiries - we need your permission to approach the police, hospital, doctor, youremployer or anyone else who can help to verify your claim. there is a place on the application formfor you to sign to allow us to make these enquiries, which are dealt with in strict confidence.3.6photographs - please do not send photographs of your injury unless we ask you to.applications on behalf of children3.7if the application is in respect of child abuse, ask us for the separate leaflet child abuse and thecriminal injuries compensation scheme. more generally, if you are applying on behalf ofsomeone under the age of 18 you must be an adult with parental responsibility for the child (ie, thenatural parent, adoptive parent or another person with legal parental responsibility). acopy of thechilds birth certificate mustbe enclosed with the application form. if the child is in care we willexpect the application to be made by the local authority if they have assumed parentalresponsibility.the application will then be signed by a responsible officer on the local authoritysbehalf. in other cases we will expect the application to be made and signed by the person havingparental responsibility for the child for the time being.43.8where there is no one legally entitled to act for the child, help should be sought from the officialsolicitor for an application in england and wales; but in the case of an application arising inscotland we may require the appointment of a tutor or guardian. we do not make these arrangementsourselves. wherever possible all necessary formalities should be completed on the childs behalfbefore an application is made so that delays do not occur at later stages. if the incident for which theclaim is made occurred some time ago, you should not delay the application but send it to us asquickly as possible.3.9if you are unsure about parental responsibility you should seek advice, for example from your localcitizensadvice bureau.adults unable to manage their own affairs3.10if you are applying on behalf of an adult who is legally incapable of managing his/her own affairs,you must be properly authorised to do so. provided that we consider you to be a suitable person wemay appoint you to act as the applicants representative for the purpose of the scheme. this willenable you to authorise all our enquiries and to decide on the applicants behalf whether to acceptthe award, to ask for a review or to appeal to the criminal injuries compensation appeals panel.before we take this step we will require medical evidence that the applicant is incapable by reasonsof mental disorder as defined in the mental health act of 1983 of managing and administeringhis/her property and affairs.part 4 - howwe dealwith your applicationacknowledgement and enquiries4.1we will acknowledge your application and give you a personal reference number which will help usto identify it quickly should you need to contact us.4.2we will then normally make enquiries of the police, medical authorities and other relevant bodies toenable your claim to be assessed.4.3it is important that you give all reasonable help to us in connection with your application(paragraph 13(c)).assessment of yourapplication4.4claims officers in the authority are responsible for deciding in accordance with the scheme whatawards (if any) should be made in individual cases, and how they should be paid.4.5as soon as we have the information we need, we will first decide whether your application isacceptable within the rules in paragraphs 6 to 12, and 38(fatal cases) of the scheme. these areexplained in some detail in parts 7-9of this guide but, amongst other factors, we will need toconsider whether an award should be withheld or reduced under any of the provisions ofparagraphs 13 to 16.personal injury4.6if your application is acceptable we will assess whether or not your injury is serious enough toqualify for at least the minimum award payable under the tariff(paragraph 25, note 1 on thetariff of awards; see also part 7.6of this guide).4.7we will then identify the tariff level into which your injury falls (paragraphs 25 to 29 and tariffof awards). to help us do that, we may ask you to attend a centre as near as possible 5to your home to have the injury examined by a doctor nominated by us (paragraph 20). we willpay reasonable travelling expenses for this purpose (covering, where appropriate, both your and acarers expenses).4.8where you suffer more than one qualifying injury, the tariff award will be that for the highest ratedinjury plus, where the other injuries are separate from the highest rated injury and from one another,10% of the tariff value of the second most serious injury and, where appropriate, 5% of the tariffvalue of the third most serious injury.this means, for example, that where the injuries are adepressed fracture of the skull (single tariff payment 6000), loss of 2 front teeth (2000) and abroken nose (1500), the combined award would be 6000 + 200 + 75 totalling 6275.4.9the tariff includes an element of compensation for the degree of shock which an applicant innormal circumstances would experience as a result of an incident resulting in injury. if the shock (asdefined in note 2 in the tariff of awards) is such that it would attract an award from a higher tarifflevel than the injury itself, then the award for shock will be paid rather than the award for injury.4.10an award will be reduced by the full amount of any payment of compensation or damages received in respect of the same injuries (paragraph 48).4.11if we make an award and you subsequently receive compensation or damages as described inparagraph 48of the scheme you will be required to pay to us the full amount of the other paymentup to the level of our award of compensation.compensation for loss of earnings (paragraphs 30-34)4.12if your injury has caused you to lose or is likely to cause you to lose earnings or earning capacity forlonger than 28 full weeks you may be eligible for additional compensation for this loss. if so, wewill ask you for details of your loss and send you a separate guide on how it is calculated.4.13please note that compensation is notpayable forthe first 28 full weeks of lost earnings orearning capacity.compensation for special expenses (paragraphs 35-36)4.14you may be considered for an additional amount of compensation if, as a direct result of the injuryyou have been incapacitated or are likely to be incapacitated for longer than 28 full weeks and haveincurred special expenses for medical/dental/optical treatment, related equipment and care. you donot have to be employed to be considered for compensation for special expenses which, providedyou meet the time condition, are payable from the date of the injury.we will ask you for details,sending you a separate guide.4.15if, after completing the personal injury application form, your circumstances change and you thinkyou may be eligible within the terms of the scheme to apply for additional compensation for loss ofearnings and/or special expenses you should write to this address quoting your reference number andgiving details of the change in your circumstances.fatal cases (paragraphs 37-44)4.16those eligible to applyare dependants or relatives (as shown in the next paragraph) of someonewho died as a result of a criminal injury, or who was criminally injured but died from some othercause.64.17 adependant or relative is someone who at the time of the deceaseds death was the deceaseds:-(a) husband or wife(b) unmarried but long term partner (of the opposite sex)(c)parent(d) *childor(e)former husband or wife who was financially supported by the deceased.* childmeans a person of any age - the definition isnotrestricted to a person below the age of 18.death as a result of a criminal injury4.18if you fall into any category at section 4.17 and the deceased died as a result of the criminal injury,we will assess your eligibility for compensation in the form of a fatal injury award and/or adependency award and/or an award for loss of parental services (paragraphs 38-42).applicationmay be made even if an award had been made to the victim for the injury before death (paragraph43).death following, but not as a result of a criminal injury4.19where the victim has died but the death was not as a result of the criminal injury you may beeligible to apply for supplementary compensation (paragraph 44). supplementary compensation isintended to cover loss of earnings, expenses and liabilities incurred by the victim before death as aresult of the crime of violence. payment of a tariff injury award cannot be made.general eligibility4.20consideration of applications for compensation in respect of fatal cases are subject to the maineligibility requirements of the scheme and apply to the applicant and the deceased (paragraphs 13and 14).funeral expenses4.21where the victim dies as a result of a criminal injury, an application will be considered forreimbursement of reasonable funeral expenses, even where the person bearing the cost of the funeralis otherwise ineligible to claim under the scheme (paragraph 37). in calculating the expenses to bereimbursed we will take account of the religious and cultural background of the victim and hisfamily.notification of our decision4.22you will be told of our decision in writing and, in cases where an award has been reduced orwithheld, you will be given reasons. any award made by us may be subject to directions andarrangements considered by us to be appropriate, taking into account the circumstances of the case(paragraph 50).7payment4.23wherever possible we will try to resolve your application by a single payment of compensation (afinal award) but to do this the medical situation needs to be clear. however, in some cases there canbe a delay and if, in all respects, you are eligible for compensation, we may make one or moreinterim awards on account (paragraph 51).we have discretion to reconsider a decision to make afinal award at any time before it is actually paid (paragraph 53).annuities4.24where it is likely that a high value award will be made, you may opt for payment through thepurchase of an annuity or annuities. these can provide index linked, tax-free payments. we will takeyou or your representativesinstructions as to which annuity to purchase. any expenses incurred willbe met from the award. (paragraph 52).reopening of cases (paragraphs 56-57)4.25we have discretion to re-open a case after a final decision has been made if the medical conditioncaused by the injury has deteriorated to such an extent that an injustice would occur if the originalcompensation assessment were allowed to stand. the following are examples of circumstances inwhich we may re-open a case:-where the injuries are now serious enough to qualify for an award; where the applicant would now qualify for an award from a higher injury band;where the applicants medical condition has deteriorated to such an extent that he/she is nolonger able to pursue his/her occupation.if any of these factors apply you should write to us asking for the case to be re-opened. you mustsupply medical evidence to support this application. if the application is made more than 2 yearsafter the date of the final decision we can only consider re-opening it if we are satisfied that it wouldnot involve us in extensive enquiries.part 5 - review of decisions (paragraphs 58-60)5.1if you consider that you have grounds to disagree with our decision you may apply for it to bereviewed. if you decide to do this you should apply in writing within 90 days from the date on ourletter giving you notice of our original decision, giving your reasons. your case will then beconsidered afresh by a claims officer more senior than the one who made the original decision. botheligibility for and the amount of any award will be reviewed and a fresh decision, with reasons, willbe sent to you. on review of the decision a claims officer may increase, reduce or withhold anaward.5.2we will send you an application forreview and a guide to review procedures when we issueour original decision.part 6 - appeals tothe criminal injuries compensation appeals panel(paragraphs 62-82)6.1if you consider that there are grounds for contesting the result of the review you may appeal, within30 days from the date on our letter giving you notice of our reviewed decision, to the criminalinjuries compensation appeals panel. the members and staff of this panel are entirely independent8from the authority and have wide powers within the terms of the scheme to consider afresh youroriginal application and any further information you wish to provide. on consideration of an appealthe panel may increase, reduce or withhold an award. adecision made by the panel, whether at anoral hearing of your case or otherwise, is final.6.2we will send you an application forappealand a guide to appeal procedures when we issueour reviewed decision.part 7 - further information on the scope ofthe schemewhere did the incident happen?7.1the injury must have been sustained in great britain or one of the other places set out in paragraph8of the scheme. injuries sustained elsewhere, for example on holiday abroad, are not eligiblealthough there could be a remedy under a similar scheme in force in the country concerned. if theinjury was sustained in northern ireland you are not eligible to apply under this scheme. northernireland has its own scheme and you should seek details from:-the compensation agency royston house34 upper queen street belfastbt1 6fdtime limit7.2do not delay in making your application which should be made within 2yearsof the date of theincident giving rise to the injury.we will not consider applications outside this period unless it isconsidered that in the particular circumstances of the case it is reasonable and in the interests ofjustice to do so.7.3the 2 year time limit is necessary because of the difficulties involved in investigating andsubstantiating late claims as we are often unable to obtain reliable evidence of police involvementand medical treatment given at the time because records are no longer available.7.4we will sympathetically consider late applications from and on behalf of victims whose ability tohelp themselves is or was impaired and from those who were under the age of 18 at the time of theincident, provided the application is received within reasonable time of the victim reaching 18.7.5we will also give careful consideration to your application if your injuries only become apparentsome time after the incident which caused them, provided the application is made as soon aspossible after discovering the cause and we can investigate and verify the details of the incident.criminal (personal) injury7.6to qualify for an award of compensation you must have suffered a physical and/or mental injury,sufficiently serious to be classified in one of the tariff bands attached to the scheme. minor injuriessuch as scratches or bruises alone will not qualify for an award but, if you have suffered acombination of minor injuries (as shown in note 1in the tariff of awards) which caused you tovisit your doctor for treatment at least twice and from which you did not recover for at least 6weeks, you may qualify.97.7to qualify for an award in respect of mental injury alone, we must be satisfied that you were put inreasonable fear of immediate physical harm to yourself, or you either witnessed or were closelyinvolved in the immediate aftermath of an incident where a person with whom you had a closerelationship of love and affection was physically injured (paragraph 9).directly attributable7.8you will only be compensated for injuries directly resulting from a crime of violence or threat ofviolence. this means that we must satisfy ourselves, on the basis of all the available facts, that notonly was the incident in which you were injured a crime of violence, but also that the incident wasthe substantial cause of your injury.you will not, however, qualify for an award if your only injuryis shock resulting from the loss of possessions following a crime which did not involve personalviolence.crime of violence7.9there is no legal definition of the term but crimes of violence usually involve a physical attack onthe person, for example assaults, wounding and sexual offences. this is not always so, however, andwe judge every case on the basis of its circumstances. for example the threat of violence may, insome circumstances, be considered a crime of violence.7.10you may be eligible for compensation even if the injuries were caused by someone who could not beheld responsible under criminal law, for example, because they were too young or insane(paragraph 10).7.11the following types of incident may in certain circumstances be regarded as crimes of violence forthe purpose of the scheme.trespass on a railway7.12if you were employed by a railway company and were present and saw another person injured orkilled as a result of trespassing on the railway you may be entitled to compensation for the shockyou suffered. you may also be entitled if you discovered a body on or beside the track or wereinvolved in the immediate aftermath of the incident. you should, however, note that to receive anaward the shock must be sufficiently serious to qualify under one of the tariff levels listed or at leastthe lowest tariff level.accidental injury7.13as a general rule, you will not be entitled to compensation if you were injured accidentally.thereare some exceptions. if your injuries were sustained as a result of your involvement (whetherintentional or not) in the prevention of an offence you may be eligible. please read prevention of anoffence andexceptional risk.prevention of an offence7.14if you were injured whilst you yourself were attempting to catch an offender, a suspected offender orhelping a police officer to catch an offender, you may be entitled to an award (see also exceptionalriskand accidental injury). you may also be entitled to an award if you were injured during thecourse of such an action even though you were not yourself taking part in it. if you were, forexample, an innocent bystander and were knocked over and injured by the offender or the pursuer,you could be entitled to an award. these conditions apply even if the suspected offence was not acrime of violence.10arson7.15if you have suffered an injury as a direct result of a crime of arson, you may be entitled to an award.if you were accidentally injured whilst fighting a fire resulting from an arson attack, or remedyingthe consequences of such an attack, you may qualify if you were taking an exceptional risk. if youare a fire fighter attending a fire resulting from an arson attack and you trip over a hose, you areunlikely to be compensated. but if, for example, your injuries are sustained in hazardouscircumstances inside a burning building, this may be considered to be an exceptional risk.exceptional risk7.16in assessing whether or not you were taking an exceptional risk, we will look at all the facts todecide whether the risk you took was exceptional and justified in all the circumstances. in generalterms, if you are a police officer who had tripped in the street in broad daylight when running toapprehend an offender you are unlikely to be compensated. similarly climbing over a wall or a fencewould not usually be considered an exceptional risk. however, an action which we would notconsider to be an exceptional risk in daylight might be so in darkness.7.17if you are an ordinary member of the public who was injured in similar circumstances whilstattempting to apprehend an offender or assisting a police officer we may, however, take a differentview. police officers, or, for example, firefighters because of their training and experience should bein a better position to assess the consequences of their actions and we believe that it would be unjustto apply the same tests to civilians. police officers injured in traffic accidents occurring during thecourse of car chases are not normally considered to be eligible for compensation unless there wassome exceptionally risky additional factor, such as severe adverse weather conditions.poisoning7.18if you have suffered an injury as a direct result of a crime of poisoning, you may be entitled to anaward.injuries caused by animals7.19this type of injury often results from an attack by a dog, but whilst such attacks can be savage andvery distressing, we have to be satisfied that the attack amounted to a crime of violence before wecan consider making an award.7.20there are generally 2 main circumstances in which we would consider making an award:-(a)if the person in charge of the dog deliberately set it on you.(b)if the attack was a result of the dog owners failure to control an animal which was known tobe vicious and the lack of control could be shown to amount to recklessness. if, for example,a dog with a previous history of vicious behaviour was allowed out without adequaterestraint or in the charge of a child, this might amount to recklessness.injuries caused by motorvehicles7 . 2 1if your injuries were caused by a motor vehicle we can only award compensation if the vehicle was ine ffect used as a weapon. we have to be satisfied that the driver of the vehicle deliberately drove it atyou in an attempt to cause you injury. the general rule is that compensation is not payable under the11scheme for injuries caused as the result of traffic offences on a public highway. in such cases, yourremedy is through the drivers insurance company or, if the driver was uninsured or unidentified,through the motor insurersbureau (mib). the address of the motor insurersbureau is:-152 silbury boulevard central milton keynes mk9 1nbchildren playing dangerous games7 . 2 2these cases present 2 problems. we must first of all be satisfied that a crime of violence has beencommitted and the fact that a game was dangerous will not in itself be sufficient. secondly, even if acrime of violence is established, we will not make an award where there is little to choose betweenthe conduct of the child who inflicted the injury and the victim. to do so would merely becompensating the loser. in a case, for example, where 11 and 12 year old boys fired stones fromcatapults at each other, and one boy received a serious eye injury, this would technically be an assaultand therefore a crime of violence. the application would, however, be rejected. in cases where thechildren are of different age groups or take unequal parts in the game, a full or reduced award may bemade depending on the degree of participation and understanding of the risks involved.part 8 - eligibilityto receive compensation (paragraph 13)8.1payment of compensation for injury as a result of a crime of violence is intended to be an expressionof public sympathy and support for innocent victims. the original scheme, introduced in 1964,envisaged that it would be inappropriate for those with significant criminal records or those whoseown conduct led to their being injured, to receive compensation from public funds. it was also feltthat people who failed to co-operate in bringing the offender to justice should not benefit from suchpayments. these provisions continue in this scheme.8.2accordingly, we have the discretion to withhold or reduce an award which might otherwise begranted if one or more of the reasons which are set out in paragraph 13of the scheme apply toyour claim.informing the police (paragraph 13(a))8.3it is not necessary for an offender to have been convicted before an award can be made. someoffenders are never found. however, we attach great importance to the duty of every victim of crimeto inform the police of all the circumstances without delay and to co-operate with their enquiries andany subsequent prosecution.8.4it is particularly important that the incident should have been reported since it is our main safeguardagainst fraud. if you have not reported the circumstances of the injury to the police, and can offer noreasonable explanation for not doing so, you should assume that any application for compensationwill be rejected. failure to inform the police is unlikely to be excused on the grounds that you fearedreprisals, or did not recognise your assailant, or saw no point in reporting it. reporting suchincidents can help the police prevent further offences against others.8.5it is for you to report the incident personally unless you are prevented from doing so because of thenature of your injuries. in this case it is then your duty to contact the police as soon as possible and co-operate with their enquiries. it is not sufficient to assume that the incident will havebeen reported by someone else because, even if it has, that person may not have known the fullcircumstances. reports by friends, relatives or workmates will not be sufficient unless there was agood reason for your not informing the police as well.128.6you must report all the relevant circumstances. if you deliberately leave out any importantinformation or otherwise mislead the police, an application for compensation will normally berejected.8.7you should report to the police at the earliest possible opportunity.failure to inform thempromptly can make further enquiries very difficult to pursue. every case is nevertheless treated on itsmerits and we will take a sympathetic view where the delay in reporting the incident to the police isclearly attributable to youth, old age, or to some physical or mental incapacity or psychologicaleffects of the crime. the requirement may also be waived if, for example, you were unaware thatyour injury was due to a crime of violence, or only discovered there was a connection long after theevent.8.8if, however, you fail to report immediately and only do so later just to make a claim forcompensation, your application is likely to be rejected.informing other organisations or someone else in authority8.9crimes of violence must be reported to the police. we will not normally accept reports made forexample to employers, trade union officials or social workers as sufficient. exceptions may bemade, however, in the case of injuries sustained, for example, in mental hospitals and prisons wherea prompt report to the appropriate person in authority represents a willingness that the matter shouldbe formally investigated. the appropriate authority in the case of a child will often be the childsparents, whose failure to inform the police will not prevent the childs claim from proceeding if itwould have been unreasonable to expect the child to take the matter any further. it should, however,be borne in mind that to consider any application we need to be able to investigate and substantiateany incident giving rise to a claim for compensation. therefore if an incident involving a child is notreported by a parent/guardian to someone in authority it is unlikely the application will succeed.there may be cases involving children where it might not necessarily be appropriate to involve thepolice. relatively minor incidents at school are examples of this. it might be in the best interest ofthe child in such cases for disciplinary action to be taken within the school and, in that type of case,we would accept a report to the school authorities as satisfactory.helping the police to prosecute (paragraph 13(b))8.10if the incident has been promptly reported to the police we have discretion to reduce or withholdcompensation if you subsequently fail to co-operate in bringing the offender to justice.8.11we make a distinction between 2 situations:-(a)where you refuse to co-operate with the police by, for example, refusing to make astatement, attend court, or make a statement which you later withdraw, we will normallymake no award.(b)where you were willing to co-operate but in the particular circumstances, it was decided bythe police or the prosecuting authority that no further action should be taken or prosecutionbrought, an award may be made, assuming that no other issues of eligibility are in question.8.12as with non-reporting, fear of reprisals will not generally be an excuse. if you at first refused to co-operate with the police but subsequently changed your mind and assisted them in all respects thenwe may consider whether a reduction of the award in respect of the initial failure or refusal to co-operate is appropriate.13failure to co-operate with the cica (paragraph 13(c))8.13we may withhold or reduce payment of an award if you persistently fail to comply with requests forinformation or otherwise fail to give all reasonable assistance to us or any other relevant authority inconnection with your application. this will include failure to attend medical examinations orinspections necessary to help us to reach a decision in your case.conduct before, during orafter the event (paragraph 13(d))8.14in this context conductmeans something which can fairly be described as bad conduct ormisconduct and includes provocative behaviour and offensive language. examples of the kind ofconduct that we can take into consideration are shown below.fighting/provocationan award may be reduced or withheld in the following circumstances:-(a)if your injury was caused in a fight in which you had voluntarily agreed to take part. this isso even if the consequences of such an agreement go far beyond what you expected. if youinvited someone outsidefor a fist-fight, we will not usually award compensation even ifyou ended up with the most serious injury.the fact that the offender went further and used aweapon will not normally make a difference.(b)if without reasonable cause you struck the first blow, regardless of the degree of retaliationor the consequence.(c)if the incident in which you were injured formed part of a pattern of violence in which youwere a voluntary participant; for example, if there was a history of assaults involving bothparties where you had previously been the assailant.(d)where you were injured whilst attempting to obtain revenge against the assailant.(e)if you used offensive language or behaved in an aggressive or threatening manner which ledto the attack which caused your injuries.criminal convictions (paragraph 13(e))8.15paragraph 13(e) of the scheme provides that an award may be withheld or reduced on account of anapplicants character as shown by his criminal convictions (excluding convictions which are spent).this is because a person who has committed criminal offences has probably caused distress and lossand injury to other persons, and has certainly caused considerable expense to society by reason ofcourt appearances and the cost of supervising sentences, even when they have been non-custodial,and the victims may themselves have sought compensation, which is another charge on society. eventhough an applicant may be blameless in the incident in which the injury was sustained, parliamenthas nevertheless provided in the scheme that convictions which are not spent under therehabilitation of offenders act 1974 should be taken into account.8.16the scale of penalty points listed opposite is an indicator of the extent to which any unspentconvictions may count against an award. these points, which are based on the type and/or length ofsentence imposed by the courts together with the time between the date of the sentence and receiptof the claim, are a guide to the gravity of an offence in relation to a claim. any sentence imposedafter the claim has been received will also be taken into account.14sentenceperiod between date of sentencepenalty of the courtand receipt of application by cica*points1imprisonmenta)period of sentence or less10 for more

suspended or not, means the sentence imposed by the court, not the time spent inprison.2.imprisonment includes a sentence of detention in a young offenders institution or borstal/borstal training orother custodialsentence.3sentences spentunder the rehabilitation of offenders act 1974 do not attract penalty points.4.other sentences will be placed into one of the above 5 categories by cicaaccording to their comparativeseriousness as measured by the rehabilitation period(s) they attract under the rehabilitation of offenders act1974. 158.17the scale of penalty points is not binding at any stage whether on decisions made by the authorityor a determination made by the criminal injuries compensation appeals panel. it is intended toprovide a readily understood guide to the relative significance of the claimants criminal record. theconvictions recorded in any individual case and the points attributable to them will be assessedwithin the context of the particular circumstances of the claim and other related factors. forexample, a points total which indicates a reduction or refusal of an award may be mitigated wherethe injury resulted from the applicants assistance to the police in upholding the law or fromgenuinely helping someone under attack. or there may be evidence of rehabilitation not otherwiseindicated by the points system which may be taken into account. conversely, a low points score isno guarantee that an award will be made where, for example, the record contains offences ofviolence or sexual offencespart 9 - violence, including sexual offences, within the familygeneral9.1it is a general condition of the scheme that any person who causes an injury (whether or not thevictim is a member of the same family) must not benefit from an award payable to the victim(paragraph 15(a)).9.2we also need to be satisfied in all cases where the application is made by or on behalf of a child that it would not be against the childs interest to make an award (paragraph 15(b)).anexample might be that a child who was very young at the time of a very minor assault, who could reasonably be expected to make a full recovery and forget that it had happened. that might bea better outcome than if we made an award, invested it on the childs behalf and released it to him or her at age 18 which might well re-open the incident in the young persons mindand cause considerable distress.9.3those considerations, while they apply to all cases, are particularly relevant to the situation wherethe victim and the offender were living in the same household as members of the same family(paragraph 16).adults9.4if you and the person who injured you were living in the same household at the time of the incident,we will not award compensation unless:-(a)the person who injured you has been prosecuted (unless there are good reasons why thiscould not happen); and(b)you and the person who injured you have permanently stopped living together.aman and woman living together as husband and wife, even if they are not married, are treated asmembers of the same family.children9.5if it was a child who was injured, condition (b) above does not apply but, as explained at 9.1 and 9.2above, we must be satisfied that the offender does not benefit, and that it would not be against thechilds interest to make an award. ask for the separate leaflet child abuse and the criminalinjuries compensation scheme.16part 10 - what standards of service can you expectto receive fromthe cica?10.1you can expect us to deal with your application courteously and confidentially, and

3(c)in england, scotland or wales at the time when the injury was sustained; and(d)injured seriously enough to qualify for at least the minimum award available under the scheme. (the tariff levels are set out in full at the end of this guide); or(e)a dependant or relative of a victim of a crime of violence who has since died (see part 4.16- 4.19 of this guide).2.4 unless there are good reasons you should also:-(a)have reported the incident personally to the police as soon as possible after it happened (butsee also part 8 of this guide);(b)send your application so that we receive it within 2 years from the date of the incidentcausing the injury (but see also part 7.2 -

7.5of this guide).3.5permission forenquiries - we need your permission to approach the police, hospital, doctor, youremployer or anyone else who can help to verify your claim. there is a place on the application formfor you to sign to allow us to make these enquiries, which are dealt with in strict confidence.3.6photographs - please do not send photographs of your injury unless we ask you to.applications on behalf of children3.7if the application is in respect of child abuse, ask us for the separate leaflet child abuse and thecriminal injuries compensation scheme. more generally, if you are applying on behalf ofsomeone under the age of 18 you must be an adult with parental responsibility for the child (ie, thenatural parent, adoptive parent or another person with legal parental responsibility). acopy of thechilds birth certificate mustbe enclosed with the application form. if the child is in care we willexpect the application to be made by the local authority if they have assumed parentalresponsibility.the application will then be signed by a responsible officer on the local authoritysbehalf. in other cases we will expect the application to be made and signed by the person havingparental responsibility for the child for the time being.43.8where there is no one legally entitled to act for the child, help should be sought from the officialsolicitor for an application in england and wales; but in the case of an application arising inscotland we may require the appointment of a tutor or guardian. we do not make these arrangementsourselves. wherever possible all necessary formalities should be completed on the childs behalfbefore an application is made so that delays do not occur at later stages. if the incident for which theclaim is made occurred some time ago, you should not delay the application but send it to us asquickly as possible.3.9if you are unsure about parental responsibility you should seek advice, for example from your localcitizensadvice bureau.adults unable to manage their own affairs3.10if you are applying on behalf of an adult who is legally incapable of managing his/her own affairs,you must be properly authorised to do so. provided that we consider you to be a suitable person wemay appoint you to act as the applicants representative for the purpose of the scheme. this willenable you to authorise all our enquiries and to decide on the applicants behalf whether to acceptthe award, to ask for a review or to appeal to the criminal injuries compensation appeals panel.before we take this step we will require medical evidence that the applicant is incapable by reasonsof mental disorder as defined in the mental health act of 1983 of managing and administeringhis/her property and affairs.part 4 - howwe dealwith your applicationacknowledgement and enquiries4.1we will acknowledge your application and give you a personal reference number which will help usto identify it quickly should you need to contact us.4.2we will then normally make enquiries of the police, medical authorities and other relevant bodies toenable your claim to be assessed.4.3it is important that you give all reasonable help to us in connection with your application(paragraph 13(c)).assessment of yourapplication4.4claims officers in the authority are responsible for deciding in accordance with the scheme whatawards (if any) should be made in individual cases, and how they should be paid.4.5as soon as we have the information we need, we will first decide whether your application isacceptable within the rules in paragraphs 6 to 12, and 38(fatal cases) of the scheme. these areexplained in some detail in parts 7-9of this guide but, amongst other factors, we will need toconsider whether an award should be withheld or reduced under any of the provisions ofparagraphs 13 to 16.personal injury4.6if your application is acceptable we will assess whether or not your injury is serious enough toqualify for at least the minimum award payable under the tariff(paragraph 25, note 1 on thetariff of awards; see also part 7.6of this guide).4.7we will then identify the tariff level into which your injury falls (paragraphs 25 to 29 and tariffof awards). to help us do that, we may ask you to attend a centre as near as possible 5to your home to have the injury examined by a doctor nominated by us (paragraph 20). we willpay reasonable travelling expenses for this purpose (covering, where appropriate, both your and acarers expenses).4.8where you suffer more than one qualifying injury, the tariff award will be that for the highest ratedinjury plus, where the other injuries are separate from the highest rated injury and from one another,10% of the tariff value of the second most serious injury and, where appropriate, 5% of the tariffvalue of the third most serious injury.this means, for example, that where the injuries are adepressed fracture of the skull (single tariff payment 6000), loss of 2 front teeth (2000) and abroken nose (1500), the combined award would be 6000 + 200 + 75 totalling 6275.4.9the tariff includes an element of compensation for the degree of shock which an applicant innormal circumstances would experience as a result of an incident resulting in injury. if the shock (asdefined in note 2 in the tariff of awards) is such that it would attract an award from a higher tarifflevel than the injury itself, then the award for shock will be paid rather than the award for injury.4.10an award will be reduced by the full amount of any payment of compensation or damages received in respect of the same injuries (paragraph 48).4.11if we make an award and you subsequently receive compensation or damages as described inparagraph 48of the scheme you will be required to pay to us the full amount of the other paymentup to the level of our award of compensation.compensation for loss of earnings (paragraphs 30-34)4.12if your injury has caused you to lose or is likely to cause you to lose earnings or earning capacity forlonger than 28 full weeks you may be eligible for additional compensation for this loss. if so, wewill ask you for details of your loss and send you a separate guide on how it is calculated.4.13please note that compensation is notpayable forthe first 28 full weeks of lost earnings orearning capacity.compensation for special expenses (paragraphs 35-36)4.14you may be considered for an additional amount of compensation if, as a direct result of the injuryyou have been incapacitated or are likely to be incapacitated for longer than 28 full weeks and haveincurred special expenses for medical/dental/optical treatment, related equipment and care. you donot have to be employed to be considered for compensation for special expenses which, providedyou meet the time condition, are payable from the date of the injury.we will ask you for details,sending you a separate guide.4.15if, after completing the personal injury application form, your circumstances change and you thinkyou may be eligible within the terms of the scheme to apply for additional compensation for loss ofearnings and/or special expenses you should write to this address quoting your reference number andgiving details of the change in your circumstances.fatal cases (paragraphs 37-44)4.16those eligible to applyare dependants or relatives (as shown in the next paragraph) of someonewho died as a result of a criminal injury, or who was criminally injured but died from some othercause.64.17 adependant or relative is someone who at the time of the deceaseds death was the deceaseds:-(a) husband or wife(b) unmarried but long term partner (of the opposite sex)(c)parent(d) *childor(e)former husband or wife who was financially supported by the deceased.* childmeans a person of any age - the definition isnotrestricted to a person below the age of 18.death as a result of a criminal injury4.18if you fall into any category at section 4.17 and the deceased died as a result of the criminal injury,we will assess your eligibility for compensation in the form of a fatal injury award and/or adependency award and/or an award for loss of parental services (paragraphs 38-42).applicationmay be made even if an award had been made to the victim for the injury before death (paragraph43).death following, but not as a result of a criminal injury4.19where the victim has died but the death was not as a result of the criminal injury you may beeligible to apply for supplementary compensation (paragraph 44). supplementary compensation isintended to cover loss of earnings, expenses and liabilities incurred by the victim before death as aresult of the crime of violence. payment of a tariff injury award cannot be made.general eligibility4.20consideration of applications for compensation in respect of fatal cases are subject to the maineligibility requirements of the scheme and apply to the applicant and the deceased (paragraphs 13and 14).funeral expenses4.21where the victim dies as a result of a criminal injury, an application will be considered forreimbursement of reasonable funeral expenses, even where the person bearing the cost of the funeralis otherwise ineligible to claim under the scheme (paragraph 37). in calculating the expenses to bereimbursed we will take account of the religious and cultural background of the victim and hisfamily.notification of our decision4.22you will be told of our decision in writing and, in cases where an award has been reduced orwithheld, you will be given reasons. any award made by us may be subject to directions andarrangements considered by us to be appropriate, taking into account the circumstances of the case(paragraph 50).7payment4.23wherever possible we will try to resolve your application by a single payment of compensation (afinal award) but to do this the medical situation needs to be clear. however, in some cases there canbe a delay and if, in all respects, you are eligible for compensation, we may make one or moreinterim awards on account (paragraph 51).we have discretion to reconsider a decision to make afinal award at any time before it is actually paid (paragraph 53).annuities4.24where it is likely that a high value award will be made, you may opt for payment through thepurchase of an annuity or annuities. these can provide index linked, tax-free payments. we will takeyou or your representativesinstructions as to which annuity to purchase. any expenses incurred willbe met from the award. (paragraph 52).reopening of cases (paragraphs 56-57)4.25we have discretion to re-open a case after a final decision has been made if the medical conditioncaused by the injury has deteriorated to such an extent that an injustice would occur if the originalcompensation assessment were allowed to stand. the following are examples of circumstances inwhich we may re-open a case:-where the injuries are now serious enough to qualify for an award; where the applicant would now qualify for an award from a higher injury band;where the applicants medical condition has deteriorated to such an extent that he/she is nolonger able to pursue his/her occupation.if any of these factors apply you should write to us asking for the case to be re-opened. you mustsupply medical evidence to support this application. if the application is made more than 2 yearsafter the date of the final decision we can only consider re-opening it if we are satisfied that it wouldnot involve us in extensive enquiries.part 5 - review of decisions (paragraphs 58-60)5.1if you consider that you have grounds to disagree with our decision you may apply for it to bereviewed. if you decide to do this you should apply in writing within 90 days from the date on ourletter giving you notice of our original decision, giving your reasons. your case will then beconsidered afresh by a claims officer more senior than the one who made the original decision. botheligibility for and the amount of any award will be reviewed and a fresh decision, with reasons, willbe sent to you. on review of the decision a claims officer may increase, reduce or withhold anaward.5.2we will send you an application forreview and a guide to review procedures when we issueour original decision.part 6 - appeals tothe criminal injuries compensation appeals panel(paragraphs 62-82)6.1if you consider that there are grounds for contesting the result of the review you may appeal, within30 days from the date on our letter giving you notice of our reviewed decision, to the criminalinjuries compensation appeals panel. the members and staff of this panel are entirely independent8from the authority and have wide powers within the terms of the scheme to consider afresh youroriginal application and any further information you wish to provide. on consideration of an appealthe panel may increase, reduce or withhold an award. adecision made by the panel, whether at anoral hearing of your case or otherwise, is final.6.2we will send you an application forappealand a guide to appeal procedures when we issueour reviewed decision.part 7 - further information on the scope ofthe schemewhere did the incident happen?7.1the injury must have been sustained in great britain or one of the other places set out in paragraph8of the scheme. injuries sustained elsewhere, for example on holiday abroad, are not eligiblealthough there could be a remedy under a similar scheme in force in the country concerned. if theinjury was sustained in northern ireland you are not eligible to apply under this scheme. northernireland has its own scheme and you should seek details from:-the compensation agency royston house34 upper queen street belfastbt1 6fdtime limit7.2do not delay in making your application which should be made within 2yearsof the date of theincident giving rise to the injury.we will not consider applications outside this period unless it isconsidered that in the particular circumstances of the case it is reasonable and in the interests ofjustice to do so.7.3the 2 year time limit is necessary because of the difficulties involved in investigating andsubstantiating late claims as we are often unable to obtain reliable evidence of police involvementand medical treatment given at the time because records are no longer available.7.4we will sympathetically consider late applications from and on behalf of victims whose ability tohelp themselves is or was impaired and from those who were under the age of 18 at the time of theincident, provided the application is received within reasonable time of the victim reaching 18.7.5we will also give careful consideration to your application if your injuries only become apparentsome time after the incident which caused them, provided the application is made as soon aspossible after discovering the cause and we can investigate and verify the details of the incident.criminal (personal) injury7.6to qualify for an award of compensation you must have suffered a physical and/or mental injury,sufficiently serious to be classified in one of the tariff bands attached to the scheme. minor injuriessuch as scratches or bruises alone will not qualify for an award but, if you have suffered acombination of minor injuries (as shown in note 1in the tariff of awards) which caused you tovisit your doctor for treatment at least twice and from which you did not recover for at least 6weeks, you may qualify.97.7to qualify for an award in respect of mental injury alone, we must be satisfied that you were put inreasonable fear of immediate physical harm to yourself, or you either witnessed or were closelyinvolved in the immediate aftermath of an incident where a person with whom you had a closerelationship of love and affection was physically injured (paragraph 9).directly attributable7.8you will only be compensated for injuries directly resulting from a crime of violence or threat ofviolence. this means that we must satisfy ourselves, on the basis of all the available facts, that notonly was the incident in which you were injured a crime of violence, but also that the incident wasthe substantial cause of your injury.you will not, however, qualify for an award if your only injuryis shock resulting from the loss of possessions following a crime which did not involve personalviolence.crime of violence7.9there is no legal definition of the term but crimes of violence usually involve a physical attack onthe person, for example assaults, wounding and sexual offences. this is not always so, however, andwe judge every case on the basis of its circumstances. for example the threat of violence may, insome circumstances, be considered a crime of violence.7.10you may be eligible for compensation even if the injuries were caused by someone who could not beheld responsible under criminal law, for example, because they were too young or insane(paragraph 10).7.11the following types of incident may in certain circumstances be regarded as crimes of violence forthe purpose of the scheme.trespass on a railway7.12if you were employed by a railway company and were present and saw another person injured orkilled as a result of trespassing on the railway you may be entitled to compensation for the shockyou suffered. you may also be entitled if you discovered a body on or beside the track or wereinvolved in the immediate aftermath of the incident. you should, however, note that to receive anaward the shock must be sufficiently serious to qualify under one of the tariff levels listed or at leastthe lowest tariff level.accidental injury7.13as a general rule, you will not be entitled to compensation if you were injured accidentally.thereare some exceptions. if your injuries were sustained as a result of your involvement (whetherintentional or not) in the prevention of an offence you may be eligible. please read prevention of anoffence andexceptional risk.prevention of an offence7.14if you were injured whilst you yourself were attempting to catch an offender, a suspected offender orhelping a police officer to catch an offender, you may be entitled to an award (see also exceptionalriskand accidental injury). you may also be entitled to an award if you were injured during thecourse of such an action even though you were not yourself taking part in it. if you were, forexample, an innocent bystander and were knocked over and injured by the offender or the pursuer,you could be entitled to an award. these conditions apply even if the suspected offence was not acrime of violence.10arson7.15if you have suffered an injury as a direct result of a crime of arson, you may be entitled to an award.if you were accidentally injured whilst fighting a fire resulting from an arson attack, or remedyingthe consequences of such an attack, you may qualify if you were taking an exceptional risk. if youare a fire fighter attending a fire resulting from an arson attack and you trip over a hose, you areunlikely to be compensated. but if, for example, your injuries are sustained in hazardouscircumstances inside a burning building, this may be considered to be an exceptional risk.exceptional risk7.16in assessing whether or not you were taking an exceptional risk, we will look at all the facts todecide whether the risk you took was exceptional and justified in all the circumstances. in generalterms, if you are a police officer who had tripped in the street in broad daylight when running toapprehend an offender you are unlikely to be compensated. similarly climbing over a wall or a fencewould not usually be considered an exceptional risk. however, an action which we would notconsider to be an exceptional risk in daylight might be so in darkness.7.17if you are an ordinary member of the public who was injured in similar circumstances whilstattempting to apprehend an offender or assisting a police officer we may, however, take a differentview. police officers, or, for example, firefighters because of their training and experience should bein a better position to assess the consequences of their actions and we believe that it would be unjustto apply the same tests to civilians. police officers injured in traffic accidents occurring during thecourse of car chases are not normally considered to be eligible for compensation unless there wassome exceptionally risky additional factor, such as severe adverse weather conditions.poisoning7.18if you have suffered an injury as a direct result of a crime of poisoning, you may be entitled to anaward.injuries caused by animals7.19this type of injury often results from an attack by a dog, but whilst such attacks can be savage andvery distressing, we have to be satisfied that the attack amounted to a crime of violence before wecan consider making an award.7.20there are generally 2 main circumstances in which we would consider making an award:-(a)if the person in charge of the dog deliberately set it on you.(b)if the attack was a result of the dog owners failure to control an animal which was known tobe vicious and the lack of control could be shown to amount to recklessness. if, for example,a dog with a previous history of vicious behaviour was allowed out without adequaterestraint or in the charge of a child, this might amount to recklessness.injuries caused by motorvehicles7 . 2 1if your injuries were caused by a motor vehicle we can only award compensation if the vehicle was ine ffect used as a weapon. we have to be satisfied that the driver of the vehicle deliberately drove it atyou in an attempt to cause you injury. the general rule is that compensation is not payable under the11scheme for injuries caused as the result of traffic offences on a public highway. in such cases, yourremedy is through the drivers insurance company or, if the driver was uninsured or unidentified,through the motor insurersbureau (mib). the address of the motor insurersbureau is:-152 silbury boulevard central milton keynes mk9 1nbchildren playing dangerous games7 . 2 2these cases present 2 problems. we must first of all be satisfied that a crime of violence has beencommitted and the fact that a game was dangerous will not in itself be sufficient. secondly, even if acrime of violence is established, we will not make an award where there is little to choose betweenthe conduct of the child who inflicted the injury and the victim. to do so would merely becompensating the loser. in a case, for example, where 11 and 12 year old boys fired stones fromcatapults at each other, and one boy received a serious eye injury, this would technically be an assaultand therefore a crime of violence. the application would, however, be rejected. in cases where thechildren are of different age groups or take unequal parts in the game, a full or reduced award may bemade depending on the degree of participation and understanding of the risks involved.part 8 - eligibilityto receive compensation (paragraph 13)8.1payment of compensation for injury as a result of a crime of violence is intended to be an expressionof public sympathy and support for innocent victims. the original scheme, introduced in 1964,envisaged that it would be inappropriate for those with significant criminal records or those whoseown conduct led to their being injured, to receive compensation from public funds. it was also feltthat people who failed to co-operate in bringing the offender to justice should not benefit from suchpayments. these provisions continue in this scheme.8.2accordingly, we have the discretion to withhold or reduce an award which might otherwise begranted if one or more of the reasons which are set out in paragraph 13of the scheme apply toyour claim.informing the police (paragraph 13(a))8.3it is not necessary for an offender to have been convicted before an award can be made. someoffenders are never found. however, we attach great importance to the duty of every victim of crimeto inform the police of all the circumstances without delay and to co-operate with their enquiries andany subsequent prosecution.8.4it is particularly important that the incident should have been reported since it is our main safeguardagainst fraud. if you have not reported the circumstances of the injury to the police, and can offer noreasonable explanation for not doing so, you should assume that any application for compensationwill be rejected. failure to inform the police is unlikely to be excused on the grounds that you fearedreprisals, or did not recognise your assailant, or saw no point in reporting it. reporting suchincidents can help the police prevent further offences against others.8.5it is for you to report the incident personally unless you are prevented from doing so because of thenature of your injuries. in this case it is then your duty to contact the police as soon as possible and co-operate with their enquiries. it is not sufficient to assume that the incident will havebeen reported by someone else because, even if it has, that person may not have known the fullcircumstances. reports by friends, relatives or workmates will not be sufficient unless there was agood reason for your not informing the police as well.128.6you must report all the relevant circumstances. if you deliberately leave out any importantinformation or otherwise mislead the police, an application for compensation will normally berejected.8.7you should report to the police at the earliest possible opportunity.failure to inform thempromptly can make further enquiries very difficult to pursue. every case is nevertheless treated on itsmerits and we will take a sympathetic view where the delay in reporting the incident to the police isclearly attributable to youth, old age, or to some physical or mental incapacity or psychologicaleffects of the crime. the requirement may also be waived if, for example, you were unaware thatyour injury was due to a crime of violence, or only discovered there was a connection long after theevent.8.8if, however, you fail to report immediately and only do so later just to make a claim forcompensation, your application is likely to be rejected.informing other organisations or someone else in authority8.9crimes of violence must be reported to the police. we will not normally accept reports made forexample to employers, trade union officials or social workers as sufficient. exceptions may bemade, however, in the case of injuries sustained, for example, in mental hospitals and prisons wherea prompt report to the appropriate person in authority represents a willingness that the matter shouldbe formally investigated. the appropriate authority in the case of a child will often be the childsparents, whose failure to inform the police will not prevent the childs claim from proceeding if itwould have been unreasonable to expect the child to take the matter any further. it should, however,be borne in mind that to consider any application we need to be able to investigate and substantiateany incident giving rise to a claim for compensation. therefore if an incident involving a child is notreported by a parent/guardian to someone in authority it is unlikely the application will succeed.there may be cases involving children where it might not necessarily be appropriate to involve thepolice. relatively minor incidents at school are examples of this. it might be in the best interest ofthe child in such cases for disciplinary action to be taken within the school and, in that type of case,we would accept a report to the school authorities as satisfactory.helping the police to prosecute (paragraph 13(b))8.10if the incident has been promptly reported to the police we have discretion to reduce or withholdcompensation if you subsequently fail to co-operate in bringing the offender to justice.8.11we make a distinction between 2 situations:-(a)where you refuse to co-operate with the police by, for example, refusing to make astatement, attend court, or make a statement which you later withdraw, we will normallymake no award.(b)where you were willing to co-operate but in the particular circumstances, it was decided bythe police or the prosecuting authority that no further action should be taken or prosecutionbrought, an award may be made, assuming that no other issues of eligibility are in question.8.12as with non-reporting, fear of reprisals will not generally be an excuse. if you at first refused to co-operate with the police but subsequently changed your mind and assisted them in all respects thenwe may consider whether a reduction of the award in respect of the initial failure or refusal to co-operate is appropriate.13failure to co-operate with the cica (paragraph 13(c))8.13we may withhold or reduce payment of an award if you persistently fail to comply with requests forinformation or otherwise fail to give all reasonable assistance to us or any other relevant authority inconnection with your application. this will include failure to attend medical examinations orinspections necessary to help us to reach a decision in your case.conduct before, during orafter the event (paragraph 13(d))8.14in this context conductmeans something which can fairly be described as bad conduct ormisconduct and includes provocative behaviour and offensive language. examples of the kind ofconduct that we can take into consideration are shown below.fighting/provocationan award may be reduced or withheld in the following circumstances:-(a)if your injury was caused in a fight in which you had voluntarily agreed to take part. this isso even if the consequences of such an agreement go far beyond what you expected. if youinvited someone outsidefor a fist-fight, we will not usually award compensation even ifyou ended up with the most serious injury.the fact that the offender went further and used aweapon will not normally make a difference.(b)if without reasonable cause you struck the first blow, regardless of the degree of retaliationor the consequence.(c)if the incident in which you were injured formed part of a pattern of violence in which youwere a voluntary participant; for example, if there was a history of assaults involving bothparties where you had previously been the assailant.(d)where you were injured whilst attempting to obtain revenge against the assailant.(e)if you used offensive language or behaved in an aggressive or threatening manner which ledto the attack which caused your injuries.criminal convictions (paragraph 13(e))8.15paragraph 13(e) of the scheme provides that an award may be withheld or reduced on account of anapplicants character as shown by his criminal convictions (excluding convictions which are spent).this is because a person who has committed criminal offences has probably caused distress and lossand injury to other persons, and has certainly caused considerable expense to society by reason ofcourt appearances and the cost of supervising sentences, even when they have been non-custodial,and the victims may themselves have sought compensation, which is another charge on society. eventhough an applicant may be blameless in the incident in which the injury was sustained, parliamenthas nevertheless provided in the scheme that convictions which are not spent under therehabilitation of offenders act 1974 should be taken into account.8.16the scale of penalty points listed opposite is an indicator of the extent to which any unspentconvictions may count against an award. these points, which are based on the type and/or length ofsentence imposed by the courts together with the time between the date of the sentence and receiptof the claim, are a guide to the gravity of an offence in relation to a claim. any sentence imposedafter the claim has been received will also be taken into account.14sentenceperiod between date of sentencepenalty of the courtand receipt of application by cica*points1imprisonmenta)period of sentence or less10 for more

at any stage whether on decisions made by the authorityor a determination made by the criminal injuries compensation appeals panel. it is intended toprovide a readily understood guide to the relative significance of the claimants criminal record. theconvictions recorded in any individual case and the points attributable to them will be assessedwithin the context of the particular circumstances of the claim and other related factors. forexample, a points total which indicates a reduction or refusal of an award may be mitigated wherethe injury resulted from the applicants assistance to the police in upholding the law or fromgenuinely helping someone under attack. or there may be evidence of rehabilitation not otherwiseindicated by the points system which may be taken into account. conversely, a low points score isno guarantee that an award will be made where, for example, the record contains offences ofviolence or sexual offencespart 9 - violence, including sexual offences, within the familygeneral9.1it is a general condition of the scheme that any person who causes an injury (whether or not thevictim is a member of the same family) must not benefit from an award payable to the victim(paragraph 15(a)).9.2we also need to be satisfied in all cases where the application is made by or on behalf of a child that it would not be against the childs interest to make an award (paragraph 15(b)).anexample might be that a child who was very young at the time of a very minor assault, who could reasonably be expected to make a full recovery and forget that it had happened. that might bea better outcome than if we made an award, invested it on the childs behalf and released it to him or her at age 18 which might well re-open the incident in the young persons mindand cause considerable distress.9.3those considerations, while they apply to all cases, are particularly relevant to the situation wherethe victim and the offender were living in the same household as members of the same family(paragraph 16).adults9.4if you and the person who injured you were living in the same household at the time of the incident,we will not award compensation unless:-(a)the person who injured you has been prosecuted (unless there are good reasons why thiscould not happen); and(b)you and the person who injured you have permanently stopped living together.aman and woman living together as husband and wife, even if they are not married, are treated asmembers of the same family.children9.5if it was a child who was injured, condition (b) above does not apply but, as explained at 9.1 and 9.2above, we must be satisfied that the offender does not benefit, and that it would not be against thechilds interest to make an award. ask for the separate leaflet child abuse and the criminalinjuries compensation scheme.16part 10 - what standards of service can you expectto receive fromthe cica?10.1you can expect us to deal with your application courteously and confidentially, and to write to youwith our decision as quickly as the time taken by other organisations to reply to our enquiries allows.10.2in particular, it is our aim:-(a)to acknowledge your application and send out all routine enquiry forms to the police andmedical authorities within 2 weeks of receipt.(b)once we have received a response to all our enquiries, to make and issue a decision within 4weeks.(c)if you decide to ask for a review of our decision, to acknowledge your application for reviewwithin 2 weeks of receipt.(d)to review your case, make a decision and notify you of that decision within 4 weeks ofreceipt of your request or, if we need to make further enquiries, within 2 weeks of receipt ofthe answers to those enquiries.(e)if you accept our decision or the appeals panel has made an award, to ensure that anypayment due is made within 4 weeks of receipt of either your acceptance or the appealspanels decision.(f)to respond to all correspondence needing a reply within 2 weeks of receipt. part 11 - complaints11.1if you are dissatisfied with the decision in your caseyou may apply for a review and, if that is notsuccessful, an appeal as outlined in this guide. once your application has been considered at boththese stages the decision will be final and there is no further action we can take.11.2if on the other hand you are dissatisfied with the way in which your application has been dealt withand wish to make a formal complaint, you should put your complaint in writing and send it to:-the operations managerthe criminal injuries compensation authoritytay house300 bath streetglasgowg2

living together as members of the same family (paragraph 7(b)).2.3for your application to be considered you must have been:-(a)a victim of a crime of violence, or injured in some other way covered by the scheme (seepart 8 of this guide);(b)physically and/or mentally injured as a result; 3(c)in england, scotland or wales at the time when the injury was sustained; and(d)injured seriously enough to qualify for at least the minimum award available under the scheme. (the tariff levels are set out in full at the end of this guide); or(e)a dependant or relative of a victim of a crime of violence who has since died (see part 4.16- 4.19 of this guide).2.4 unless there are good reasons you should also:-(a)have reported the incident personally to the police as soon as possible after it happened (butsee also part 8 of this guide);(b)send your application so that we receive it within 2 years from the date of the incidentcausing the injury (but see also part 7.2 - 7.5 of this guide).part 3 - howand when toapply3.1application forms and related guides are obtainable from our office at the address at the beginningof this guide.3.2personal injury-if you have been injured, please ask for and complete apersonal injuryapplication form.3.3fatal injury- if you intend to apply following the death of a victim of a crime of violence, pleaseask for and complete a fatal injuryapplication form.3.4time limit- completed applications should be sent to us as soon as possible, and must be receivedat our office no later than 2yearsafter the incident for which a claim is made (paragraph 17).this time limit may, however, be waived if we consider that there is a good reason for the delay andit is in the interests of justice to do so. for an application to proceed there must be enoughinformation still available for us to assess your claim (see also parts 7.2 - 7.5of this guide).3.5permission forenquiries - we need your permission to approach the police, hospital, doctor, youremployer or anyone else who can help to verify your claim. there is a place on the application formfor you to sign to allow us to make these enquiries, which are dealt with in strict confidence.3.6photographs - please do not send photographs of your injury unless we ask you to.applications on behalf of children3.7if the application is in respect of child abuse, ask us for the separate leaflet child abuse and thecriminal injuries compensation scheme. more generally, if you are applying on behalf ofsomeone under the age of 18 you must be an adult with parental responsibility for the child (ie, thenatural parent, adoptive parent or another person with legal parental responsibility). acopy of thechilds birth certificate mustbe enclosed with the application form. if the child is in care we willexpect the application to be made by the local authority if they have assumed parentalresponsibility.the application will then be signed by a responsible officer on the local authoritysbehalf. in other cases we will expect the application to be made and signed by the person havingparental responsibility for the child for the time being.43.8where there is no one legally entitled to act for the child, help should be sought from the officialsolicitor for an application in england and wales; but in the case of an application arising inscotland we may require the appointment of a tutor or guardian. we do not make these arrangementsourselves. wherever possible all necessary formalities should be completed on the childs behalfbefore an application is made so that delays do not occur at later stages. if the incident for which theclaim is made occurred some time ago, you should not delay the application but send it to us asquickly as possible.3.9if you are unsure about parental responsibility you should seek advice, for example from your localcitizensadvice bureau.adults unable to manage their own affairs3.10if you are applying on behalf of an adult who is legally incapable of managing his/her own affairs,you must be properly authorised to do so. provided that we consider you to be a suitable person wemay appoint you to act as the applicants representative for the purpose of the scheme. this willenable you to authorise all our enquiries and to decide on the applicants behalf whether to acceptthe award, to ask for a review or to appeal to the criminal injuries compensation appeals panel.before we take this step we will require medical evidence that the applicant is incapable by reasonsof mental disorder as defined in the mental health act of 1983 of managing and administeringhis/her property and affairs.part 4 - howwe dealwith your applicationacknowledgement and enquiries4.1we will acknowledge your application and give you a personal reference number which will help usto identify it quickly should you need to contact us.4.2we will then normally make enquiries of the police, medical authorities and other relevant bodies toenable your claim to be assessed.4.3it is important that you give all reasonable help to us in connection with your application(paragraph 13(c)).assessment of yourapplication4.4claims officers in the authority are responsible for deciding in accordance with the scheme whatawards (if any) should be made in individual cases, and how they should be paid.4.5as soon as we have the information we need, we will first decide whether your application isacceptable within the rules in paragraphs 6 to 12, and 38(fatal cases) of the scheme. these areexplained in some detail in parts 7-9of this guide but, amongst other factors, we will need toconsider whether an award should be withheld or reduced under any of the provisions ofparagraphs 13 to 16.personal injury4.6if your application is acceptable we will assess whether or not your injury is serious enough toqualify for at least the minimum award payable under the tariff(paragraph 25, note 1 on thetariff of awards; see also part 7.6of this guide).4.7we will then identify the tariff level into which your injury falls (paragraphs 25 to 29 and tariffof awards). to help us do that, we may ask you to attend a centre as near as possible 5to your home to have the injury examined by a doctor nominated by us (paragraph 20). we willpay reasonable travelling expenses for this purpose (covering, where appropriate, both your and acarers expenses).4.8where you suffer more than one qualifying injury, the tariff award will be that for the highest ratedinjury plus, where the other injuries are separate from the highest rated injury and from one another,10% of the tariff value of the second most serious injury and, where appropriate, 5% of the tariffvalue of the third most serious injury.this means, for example, that where the injuries are adepressed fracture of the skull (single tariff payment 6000), loss of 2 front teeth (2000) and abroken nose (1500), the combined award would be 6000 + 200 + 75 totalling 6275.4.9the tariff includes an element of compensation for the degree of shock which an applicant innormal circumstances would experience as a result of an incident resulting in injury. if the shock (asdefined in note 2 in the tariff of awards) is such that it would attract an award from a higher tarifflevel than the injury itself, then the award for shock will be paid rather than the award for injury.4.10an award will be reduced by the full amount of any payment of compensation or damages received in respect of the same injuries (paragraph 48).4.11if we make an award and you subsequently receive compensation or damages as described inparagraph 48of the scheme you will be required to pay to us the full amount of the other paymentup to the level of our award of compensation.compensation for loss of earnings (paragraphs 30-34)4.12if your injury has caused you to lose or is likely to cause you to lose earnings or earning capacity forlonger than 28 full weeks you may be eligible for additional compensation for this loss. if so, wewill ask you for details of your loss and send you a separate guide on how it is calculated.4.13please note that compensation is notpayable forthe first 28 full weeks of lost earnings orearning capacity.compensation for special expenses (paragraphs 35-36)4.14you may be considered for an additional amount of compensation if, as a direct result of the injuryyou have been incapacitated or are likely to be incapacitated for longer than 28 full weeks and haveincurred special expenses for medical/dental/optical treatment, related equipment and care. you donot have to be employed to be considered for compensation for special expenses which, providedyou meet the time condition, are payable from the date of the injury.we will ask you for details,sending you a separate guide.4.15if, after completing the personal injury application form, your circumstances change and you thinkyou may be eligible within the terms of the scheme to apply for additional compensation for loss ofearnings and/or special expenses you should write to this address quoting your reference number andgiving details of the change in your circumstances.fatal cases (paragraphs 37-44)4.16those eligible to applyare dependants or relatives (as shown in the next paragraph) of someonewho died as a result of a criminal injury, or who was criminally injured but died from some othercause.64.17 adependant or relative is someone who at the time of the deceaseds death was the deceaseds:-(a) husband or wife(b) unmarried but long term partner (of the opposite sex)(c)parent(d) *childor(e)former husband or wife who was financially supported by the deceased.* childmeans a person of any age - the definition isnotrestricted to a person below the age of 18.death as a result of a criminal injury4.18if you fall into any category at section 4.17 and the deceased died as a result of the criminal injury,we will assess your eligibility for compensation in the form of a fatal injury award and/or adependency award and/or an award for loss of parental services (paragraphs 38-42).applicationmay be made even if an award had been made to the victim for the injury before death (paragraph43).death following, but not as a result of a criminal injury4.19where the victim has died but the death was not as a result of the criminal injury you may beeligible to apply for supplementary compensation (paragraph 44). supplementary compensation isintended to cover loss of earnings, expenses and liabilities incurred by the victim before death as aresult of the crime of violence. payment of a tariff injury award cannot be made.general eligibility4.20consideration of applications for compensation in respect of fatal cases are subject to the maineligibility requirements of the scheme and apply to the applicant and the deceased (paragraphs 13and 14).funeral expenses4.21where the victim dies as a result of a criminal injury, an application will be considered forreimbursement of reasonable funeral expenses, even where the person bearing the cost of the funeralis otherwise ineligible to claim under the scheme (paragraph 37). in calculating the expenses to bereimbursed we will take account of the religious and cultural background of the victim and hisfamily.notification of our decision4.22you will be told of our decision in writing and, in cases where an award has been reduced orwithheld, you will be given reasons. any award made by us may be subject to directions andarrangements considered by us to be appropriate, taking into account the circumstances of the case(paragraph 50).7payment4.23wherever possible we will try to resolve your application by a single payment of compensation (afinal award) but to do this the medical situation needs to be clear. however, in some cases there canbe a delay and if, in all respects, you are eligible for compensation, we may make one or moreinterim awards on account (paragraph 51).we have discretion to reconsider a decision to make afinal award at any time before it is actually paid (paragraph 53).annuities4.24where it is likely that a high value award will be made, you may opt for payment through thepurchase of an annuity or annuities. these can provide index linked, tax-free payments. we will takeyou or your representativesinstructions as to which annuity to purchase. any expenses incurred willbe met from the award. (paragraph 52).reopening of cases (paragraphs 56-57)4.25we have discretion to re-open a case after a final decision has been made if the medical conditioncaused by the injury has deteriorated to such an extent that an injustice would occur if the originalcompensation assessment were allowed to stand. the following are examples of circumstances inwhich we may re-open a case:-where the injuries are now serious enough to qualify for an award; where the applicant would now qualify for an award from a higher injury band;where the applicants medical condition has deteriorated to such an extent that he/she is nolonger able to pursue his/her occupation.if any of these factors apply you should write to us asking for the case to be re-opened. you mustsupply medical evidence to support this application. if the application is made more than 2 yearsafter the date of the final decision we can only consider re-opening it if we are satisfied that it wouldnot involve us in extensive enquiries.part 5 - review of decisions (paragraphs 58-60)5.1if you consider that you have grounds to disagree with our decision you may apply for it to bereviewed. if you decide to do this you should apply in writing within 90 days from the date on ourletter giving you notice of our original decision, giving your reasons. your case will then beconsidered afresh by a claims officer more senior than the one who made the original decision. botheligibility for and the amount of any award will be reviewed and a fresh decision, with reasons, willbe sent to you. on review of the decision a claims officer may increase, reduce or withhold anaward.5.2we will send you an application forreview and a guide to review procedures when we issueour original decision.part 6 - appeals tothe criminal injuries compensation appeals panel(paragraphs 62-82)6.1if you consider that there are grounds for contesting the result of the review you may appeal, within30 days from the date on our letter giving you notice of our reviewed decision, to the criminalinjuries compensation appeals panel. the members and staff of this panel are entirely independent8from the authority and have wide powers within the terms of the scheme to consider afresh youroriginal application and any further information you wish to provide. on consideration of an appealthe panel may increase, reduce or withhold an award. adecision made by the panel, whether at anoral hearing of your case or otherwise, is final.6.2we will send you an application forappealand a guide to appeal procedures when we issueour reviewed decision.part 7 - further information on the scope ofthe schemewhere did the incident happen?7.1the injury must have been sustained in great britain or one of the other places set out in paragraph8of the scheme. injuries sustained elsewhere, for example on holiday abroad, are not eligiblealthough there could be a remedy under a similar scheme in force in the country concerned. if theinjury was sustained in northern ireland you are not eligible to apply under this scheme. northernireland has its own scheme and you should seek details from:-the compensation agency royston house34 upper queen street belfastbt1 6fdtime limit7.2do not delay in making your application which should be made within 2yearsof the date of theincident giving rise to the injury.we will not consider applications outside this period unless it isconsidered that in the particular circumstances of the case it is reasonable and in the interests ofjustice to do so.7.3the 2 year time limit is necessary because of the difficulties involved in investigating andsubstantiating late claims as we are often unable to obtain reliable evidence of police involvementand medical treatment given at the time because records are no longer available.7.4we will sympathetically consider late applications from and on behalf of victims whose ability tohelp themselves is or was impaired and from those who were under the age of 18 at the time of theincident, provided the application is received within reasonable time of the victim reaching 18.7.5we will also give careful consideration to your application if your injuries only become apparentsome time after the incident which caused them, provided the application is made as soon aspossible after discovering the cause and we can investigate and verify the details of the incident.criminal (personal) injury7.6to qualify for an award of compensation you must have suffered a physical and/or mental injury,sufficiently serious to be classified in one of the tariff bands attached to the scheme. minor injuriessuch as scratches or bruises alone will not qualify for an award but, if you have suffered acombination of minor injuries (as shown in note 1in the tariff of awards) which caused you tovisit your doctor for treatment at least twice and from which you did not recover for at least 6weeks, you may qualify.97.7to qualify for an award in respect of mental injury alone, we must be satisfied that you were put inreasonable fear of immediate physical harm to yourself, or you either witnessed or were closelyinvolved in the immediate aftermath of an incident where a person with whom you had a closerelationship of love and affection was physically injured (paragraph 9).directly attributable7.8you will only be compensated for injuries directly resulting from a crime of violence or threat ofviolence. this means that we must satisfy ourselves, on the basis of all the available facts, that notonly was the incident in which you were injured a crime of violence, but also that the incident wasthe substantial cause of your injury.you will not, however, qualify for an award if your only injuryis shock resulting from the loss of possessions following a crime which did not involve personalviolence.crime of violence7.9there is no legal definition of the term but crimes of violence usually involve a physical attack onthe person, for example assaults, wounding and sexual offences. this is not always so, however, andwe judge every case on the basis of its circumstances. for example the threat of violence may, insome circumstances, be considered a crime of violence.7.10you may be eligible for compensation even if the injuries were caused by someone who could not beheld responsible under criminal law, for example, because they were too young or insane(paragraph 10).7.11the following types of incident may in certain circumstances be regarded as crimes of violence forthe purpose of the scheme.trespass on a railway7.12if you were employed by a railway company and were present and saw another person injured orkilled as a result of trespassing on the railway you may be entitled to compensation for the shockyou suffered. you may also be entitled if you discovered a body on or beside the track or wereinvolved in the immediate aftermath of the incident. you should, however, note that to receive anaward the shock must be sufficiently serious to qualify under one of the tariff levels listed or at leastthe lowest tariff level.accidental injury7.13as a general rule, you will not be entitled to compensation if you were injured accidentally.thereare some exceptions. if your injuries were sustained as a result of your involvement (whetherintentional or not) in the prevention of an offence you may be eligible. please read prevention of anoffence andexceptional risk.prevention of an offence7.14if you were injured whilst you yourself were attempting to catch an offender, a suspected offender orhelping a police officer to catch an offender, you may be entitled to an award (see also exceptionalriskand accidental injury). you may also be entitled to an award if you were injured during thecourse of such an action even though you were not yourself taking part in it. if you were, forexample, an innocent bystander and were knocked over and injured by the offender or the pursuer,you could be entitled to an award. these conditions apply even if the suspected offence was not acrime of violence.10arson7.15if you have suffered an injury as a direct result of a crime of arson, you may be entitled to an award.if you were accidentally injured whilst fighting a fire resulting from an arson attack, or remedyingthe consequences of such an attack, you may qualify if you were taking an exceptional risk. if youare a fire fighter attending a fire resulting from an arson attack and you trip over a hose, you areunlikely to be compensated. but if, for example, your injuries are sustained in hazardouscircumstances inside a burning building, this may be considered to be an exceptional risk.exceptional risk7.16in assessing whether or not you were taking an exceptional risk, we will look at all the facts todecide whether the risk you took was exceptional and justified in all the circumstances. in generalterms, if you are a police officer who had tripped in the street in broad daylight when running toapprehend an offender you are unlikely to be compensated. similarly climbing over a wall or a fencewould not usually be considered an exceptional risk. however, an action which we would notconsider to be an exceptional risk in daylight might be so in darkness.7.17if you are an ordinary member of the public who was injured in similar circumstances whilstattempting to apprehend an offender or assisting a police officer we may, however, take a differentview. police officers, or, for example, firefighters because of their training and experience should bein a better position to assess the consequences of their actions and we believe that it would be unjustto apply the same tests to civilians. police officers injured in traffic accidents occurring during thecourse of car chases are not normally considered to be eligible for compensation unless there wassome exceptionally risky additional factor, such as severe adverse weather conditions.poisoning7.18if you have suffered an injury as a direct result of a crime of poisoning, you may be entitled to anaward.injuries caused by animals7.19this type of injury often results from an attack by a dog, but whilst such attacks can be savage andvery distressing, we have to be satisfied that the attack amounted to a crime of violence before wecan consider making an award.7.20there are generally 2 main circumstances in which we would consider making an award:-(a)if the person in charge of the dog deliberately set it on you.(b)if the attack was a result of the dog owners failure to control an animal which was known tobe vicious and the lack of control could be shown to amount to recklessness. if, for example,a dog with a previous history of vicious behaviour was allowed out without adequaterestraint or in the charge of a child, this might amount to recklessness.injuries caused by motorvehicles7 . 2 1if your injuries were caused by a motor vehicle we can only award compensation if the vehicle was ine ffect used as a weapon. we have to be satisfied that the driver of the vehicle deliberately drove it atyou in an attempt to cause you injury. the general rule is that compensation is not payable under the11scheme for injuries caused as the result of traffic offences on a public highway. in such cases, yourremedy is through the drivers insurance company or, if the driver was uninsured or unidentified,through the motor insurersbureau (mib). the address of the motor insurersbureau is:-152 silbury boulevard central milton keynes mk9 1nbchildren playing dangerous games7 . 2 2these cases present 2 problems. we must first of all be satisfied that a crime of violence has beencommitted and the fact that a game was dangerous will not in itself be sufficient. secondly, even if acrime of violence is established, we will not make an award where there is little to choose betweenthe conduct of the child who inflicted the injury and the victim. to do so would merely becompensating the loser. in a case, for example, where 11 and 12 year old boys fired stones fromcatapults at each other, and one boy received a serious eye injury, this would technically be an assaultand therefore a crime of violence. the application would, however, be rejected. in cases where thechildren are of different age groups or take unequal parts in the game, a full or reduced award may bemade depending on the degree of participation and understanding of the risks involved.part 8 - eligibilityto receive compensation (paragraph 13)8.1payment of compensation for injury as a result of a crime of violence is intended to be an expressionof public sympathy and support for innocent victims. the original scheme, introduced in 1964,envisaged that it would be inappropriate for those with significant criminal records or those whoseown conduct led to their being injured, to receive compensation from public funds. it was also feltthat people who failed to co-operate in bringing the offender to justice should not benefit from suchpayments. these provisions continue in this scheme.8.2accordingly, we have the discretion to withhold or reduce an award which might otherwise begranted if one or more of the reasons which are set out in paragraph 13of the scheme apply toyour claim.informing the police (paragraph 13(a))8.3it is not necessary for an offender to have been convicted before an award can be made. someoffenders are never found. however, we attach great importance to the duty of every victim of crimeto inform the police of all the circumstances without delay and to co-operate with their enquiries andany subsequent prosecution.8.4it is particularly important that the incident should have been reported since it is our main safeguardagainst fraud. if you have not reported the circumstances of the injury to the police, and can offer noreasonable explanation for not doing so, you should assume that any application for compensationwill be rejected. failure to inform the police is unlikely to be excused on the grounds that you fearedreprisals, or did not recognise your assailant, or saw no point in reporting it. reporting suchincidents can help the police prevent further offences against others.8.5it is for you to report the incident personally unless you are prevented from doing so because of thenature of your injuries. in this case it is then your duty to contact the police as soon as possible and co-operate with their enquiries. it is not sufficient to assume that the incident will havebeen reported by someone else because, even if it has, that person may not have known the fullcircumstances. reports by friends, relatives or workmates will not be sufficient unless there was agood reason for your not informing the police as well.128.6you must report all the relevant circumstances. if you deliberately leave out any importantinformation or otherwise mislead the police, an application for compensation will normally berejected.8.7you should report to the police at the earliest possible opportunity.failure to inform thempromptly can make further enquiries very difficult to pursue. every case is nevertheless treated on itsmerits and we will take a sympathetic view where the delay in reporting the incident to the police isclearly attributable to youth, old age, or to some physical or mental incapacity or psychologicaleffects of the crime. the requirement may also be waived if, for example, you were unaware thatyour injury was due to a crime of violence, or only discovered there was a connection long after theevent.8.8if, however, you fail to report immediately and only do so later just to make a claim forcompensation, your application is likely to be rejected.informing other organisations or someone else in authority8.9crimes of violence must be reported to the police. we will not normally accept reports made forexample to employers, trade union officials or social workers as sufficient. exceptions may bemade, however, in the case of injuries sustained, for example, in mental hospitals and prisons wherea prompt report to the appropriate person in authority represents a willingness that the matter shouldbe formally investigated. the appropriate authority in the case of a child will often be the childsparents, whose failure to inform the police will not prevent the childs claim from proceeding if itwould have been unreasonable to expect the child to take the matter any further. it should, however,be borne in mind that to consider any application we need to be able to investigate and substantiateany incident giving rise to a claim for compensation. therefore if an incident involving a child is notreported by a parent/guardian to someone in authority it is unlikely the application will succeed.there may be cases involving children where it might not necessarily be appropriate to involve thepolice. relatively minor incidents at school are examples of this. it might be in the best interest ofthe child in such cases for disciplinary action to be taken within the school and, in that type of case,we would accept a report to the school authorities as satisfactory.helping the police to prosecute (paragraph 13(b))8.10if the incident has been promptly reported to the police we have discretion to reduce or withholdcompensation if you subsequently fail to co-operate in bringing the offender to justice.8.11we make a distinction between 2 situations:-(a)where you refuse to co-operate with the police by, for example, refusing to make astatement, attend court, or make a statement which you later withdraw, we will normallymake no award.(b)where you were willing to co-operate but in the particular circumstances, it was decided bythe police or the prosecuting authority that no further action should be taken or prosecutionbrought, an award may be made, assuming that no other issues of eligibility are in question.8.12as with non-reporting, fear of reprisals will not generally be an excuse. if you at first refused to co-operate with the police but subsequently changed your mind and assisted them in all respects thenwe may consider whether a reduction of the award in respect of the initial failure or refusal to co-operate is appropriate.13failure to co-operate with the cica (paragraph 13(c))8.13we may withhold or reduce payment of an award if you persistently fail to comply with requests forinformation or otherwise fail to give all reasonable assistance to us or any other relevant authority inconnection with your application. this will include failure to attend medical examinations orinspections necessary to help us to reach a decision in your case.conduct before, during orafter the event (paragraph 13(d))8.14in this context conductmeans something which can fairly be described as bad conduct ormisconduct and includes provocative behaviour and offensive language. examples of the kind ofconduct that we can take into consideration are shown below.fighting/provocationan award may be reduced or withheld in the following circumstances:-(a)if your injury was caused in a fight in which you had voluntarily agreed to take part. this isso even if the consequences of such an agreement go far beyond what you expected. if youinvited someone outsidefor a fist-fight, we will not usually award compensation even ifyou ended up with the most serious injury.the fact that the offender went further and used aweapon will not normally make a difference.(b)if without reasonable cause you struck the first blow, regardless of the degree of retaliationor the consequence.(c)if the incident in which you were injured formed part of a pattern of violence in which youwere a voluntary participant; for example, if there was a history of assaults involving bothparties where you had previously been the assailant.(d)where you were injured whilst attempting to obtain revenge against the assailant.(e)if you used offensive language or behaved in an aggressive or threatening manner which ledto the attack which caused your injuries.criminal convictions (paragraph 13(e))8.15paragraph 13(e) of the scheme provides that an award may be withheld or reduced on account of anapplicants character as shown by his criminal convictions (excluding convictions which are spent).this is because a person who has committed criminal offences has probably caused distress and lossand injury to other persons, and has certainly caused considerable expense to society by reason ofcourt appearances and the cost of supervising sentences, even when they have been non-custodial,and the victims may themselves have sought compensation, which is another charge on society. eventhough an applicant may be blameless in the incident in which the injury was sustained, parliamenthas nevertheless provided in the scheme that convictions which are not spent under therehabilitation of offenders act 1974 should be taken into account.8.16the scale of penalty points listed opposite is an indicator of the extent to which any unspentconvictions may count against an award. these points, which are based on the type and/or length ofsentence imposed by the courts together with the time between the date of the sentence and receiptof the claim, are a guide to the gravity of an offence in relation to a claim. any sentence imposedafter the claim has been received will also be taken into account.14sentenceperiod between date of sentencepenalty of the courtand receipt of application by cica*points1imprisonmenta)period of sentence or less10 for more

at any stage whether on decisions made by the authorityor a determination made by the criminal injuries compensation appeals panel. it is intended toprovide a readily understood guide to the relative significance of the claimants criminal record. theconvictions recorded in any individual case and the points attributable to them will be assessedwithin the context of the particular circumstances of the claim and other related factors. forexample, a points total which indicates a reduction or refusal of an award may be mitigated wherethe injury resulted from the applicants assistance to the police in upholding the law or fromgenuinely helping someone under attack. or there may be evidence of rehabilitation not otherwiseindicated by the points system which may be taken into account. conversely, a low points score isno guarantee that an award will be made where, for example, the record contains offences ofviolence or sexual offencespart 9 - violence, including sexual offences, within the familygeneral9.1it is a general condition of the scheme that any person who causes an injury (whether or not thevictim is a member of the same family) must not benefit from an award payable to the victim(paragraph 15(a)).9.2we also need to be satisfied in all cases where the application is made by or on behalf of a child that it would not be against the childs interest to make an award (paragraph 15(b)).anexample might be that a child who was very young at the time of a very minor assault, who could reasonably be expected to make a full recovery and forget that it had happened. that might bea better outcome than if we made an award, invested it on the childs behalf and released it to him or her at age 18 which might well re-open the incident in the young persons mindand cause considerable distress.9.3those considerations, while they apply to all cases, are particularly relevant to the situation wherethe victim and the offender were living in the same household as members of the same family(paragraph 16).adults9.4if you and the person who injured you were living in the same household at the time of the incident,we will not award compensation unless:-(a)the person who injured you has been prosecuted (unless there are good reasons why thiscould not happen); and(b)you and the person who injured you have permanently stopped living together.aman and woman living together as husband and wife, even if they are not married, are treated asmembers of the same family.children9.5if it was a child who was injured, condition (b) above does not apply but, as explained at 9.1 and 9.2above, we must be satisfied that the offender does not benefit, and that it would not be against thechilds interest to make an award. ask for the separate leaflet child abuse and the criminalinjuries compensation scheme.16part 10 - what standards of service can you expectto receive fromthe cica?10.1you can expect us to deal with your application courteously and confidentially, and

ut9-leaflet-eng.txt,". it may also be of assistance to local authorities. it describes the processes necessary to appeal to the administrative appeals chamber of the upper tribunal from a decision given by the special educational needs tribunal for wales (sentw) once you have asked sentw for permission to appeal.  it explains, in outline, the stages in an appeal before it is decided by an upper tribunal judge and sets out the rights of appeal from a judges decision. however, it is only a guide and does not have legal status.  it does not cover all aspects of every situation, nor does it provide a full interpretation of the procedural rules.    in particular the leaflet does not describe any of sentws procedures or how to apply for permission to appeal to sentw which is an essential first step in appealing to the upper tribunal. sentw will have provided information about this.     what is the administrative appeals chamber of upper tribunal?   the upper tribunal is a new

be subject to challenge by appeal to the high court.   3  the administrative appeals chamber of the upper tribunal consists of high court judges and other specialist judges appointed by the queen.    there is a small team of in-house lawyers called registrars who may assist the upper tribunal judges.  they have been authorised by the senior president of tribunals to deal with procedural stages of cases.  a judge will always decide an application for permission to appeal and an appeal.  where are the offices of the administrative appeals chamber of the upper tribunal?  the address of the office
