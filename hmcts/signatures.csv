cb1-eng.txt,"page 1 cb1family mediation before you begin court proceedings you are required to attend a mediation information assessment meeting (miam). in mediation, an impartial, trained mediator, not connected with your case, helps you and your partner to sort out your disputes. mediation is not about getting back together. it is a chance for couples who are splitting up to meet with someone who has been properly trained. this will help you to make arrangements for any number of things, including your children, your money or your home. you should attend a mediation information and assessment meeting before you begin court proceedings in order for your application to be processed. to nd your nearest family mediation service, visit the governments website gov.uk and search using the words family mediation. you will nd a database of family mediation services on the website. the mediation information and assessment meeting does not take long and will provide you with an assessment of your situation and whether mediation could solve your problems. depending on your personal circumstances you may need to pay for the meeting. its important to bear in mind that successful mediation can reduce costs for you in the long term. you may be able to get help with the cost of mediation. for more information, go online to www.gov.uk/legal-aid making an applicationchildren and the family courts page 2 parenting plans: putting children rst a guide for separating parents parenting plans: putting children rst - a guide for separating parents is a free booklet designed to help parents reach agreement about arrangements for their children following separation or divorce. you can get a copy from your local family court or you can download a copy from www.tsoshop.co.uk, search for parenting plan. you can get a welsh version from any cafcass cymru ofce or any welsh court. parenting plans looks at issues you may need to consider in making arrangements for your children, and includes practical examples of how other parents in a variety of family structures and circumstances have solved problems. it also provides a list of organisations that can give further advice and help. the court makes most decisions about children using a law, called the children act 1989. if you want the court to make a decision about a child, you need to apply to the court for an order. an order will be made when either the judge, legal advisor or panel of magistrates makes a decision. page 3 a how the court can help you some of the orders you may want to apply for are described below. these are just some of the decisions a court can make under the children act 1989. type of order description child arrangements order a child arrangements order decides the arrangements for whom a child is to live with, spend time with or otherwise have contact with and where a child is to live, spend time or otherwise have contact with any person. for example, if your child lives with your ex-partner and you want to see your child at weekends, or you cannot agree which parent the child is to live with, you might want to apply for a child arrangements order. specic issue order these orders give instructions about a specic issue that has arisen about an action normally done by a parent. for example, if you and your ex-partner cannot agree which school to send your child to. prohibited steps order these orders mean a person must have the courts permission before doing something set out in the order that would normally be done by a parent. for example, if a parent needs the courts permission before taking the child to a foreign country. parental responsibility order parental responsibility means all the rights, duties, powers, responsibility and authority which by law a parent of a child has in relation to the child and his property. for example, if you are the father of a child but you were not married to the childs mother and were not named on the birth certicate when the childs birth was registered, but you want to be recognised legally as the childs father, you may apply for a parental responsibility order. page 4 financial provision child maintenance is regular, reliable nancial support that helps towards a childs everyday living costs. child maintenance can make a real difference to childrens lives and can help pay for things like clothing, food and other essentials. many parents choose to work together to set up a child maintenance arrangement. these family-based arrangements can include other things and do not have to be just about paying money. if an arrangement is not possible there are other options. there is a helpful free service called child maintenance options which can tell you more about child maintenance and help you set up an arrangement. call child maintenance options on 0800 988 0988, visit www.cmoptions.org or text options to 66644 for a free call back. (calls to 0800 numbers are free from bt landlines but you may have to pay more if you use another phone company, a mobile phone, or if you are calling from abroad. calls from mobile phones can cost considerably more a minute, so check the cost of calls with your service provider. sms texts will be charged at your standard network rate. they prompt a call back to your phone from a child maintenance options agent. you will not be charged for the call.) appointment of a guardian a guardian appointed under this section will generally take over parental responsibility for the child after the death of a parent. for example, if your niece or nephew has lost both their parents you might apply to be a guardian. page 5 special guardianship the special guardian of a child can take most decisions about the child until the child is 18. unlike adoption, the child will keep their ties to their birth family. if you want to know more you should read leaet cb4 special guardianship - a guide for court users .order related to enforcement of a child arrangements order if you were involved in proceedings where a child arrangements order was made, and the order is not being kept to, you might be able to apply to the court to have that order enforced. you should read leaet cb5 applications related to enforcement of a child arrangements order to learn more about enforcing a child arrangements order order and how to make an application. adoption if you want to apply to adopt a child you should read leaet a20 adoption - a guide to court users .you can get a copy from any family court ofce or you can download it from our website hmctsformnder.justice.gov.uk page 6 b what a court might decide a court will only make an order if it thinks that would be best for the child. sometimes a court may decide that it would be best not to make any order. a court might: make an order; change an order (called varying the order); or end an order (called discharging the order). if the court makes an order it will be based on what is best for your child. this might mean that you, or the other person, will not get exactly what you have asked for. once a case has started a court may make other decisions. these include: giving instructions that people must follow (these are called directions); or transferring a case to another court. the law you do not need to know the law to apply but if you want to read more about the law you need a copy of: the children act 1989; and the family procedure rules. the accompanying practice directions are available on the internet or from your local court, or they may be available at your local library. page 7 c who can apply for an order do i need to apply for permission?

(it is almost always possible to give at least informal notice in one of the ways described above.) page 3 if you make an urgent application without notice, you must give the judge or magistrates as much information about the case as you can. this means that you must tell them about the things which concern you (and which have caused you to make this application), and of all the things which you think the other person would say in reply if they were at court. section 4(b) of the c100 gives you space to do this. the court will generally only make an order without notice if you have provided a full, signed account of the evidence on which you are relying and conrmed it to be true. you can do this in sections 4(a) and 4(b) of the c100 form. if you want to provide more information, you can do so in a written statement which should also contain a declaration of truth which you must sign. ideally any further statement should be typed (though it doesnt have to be) and you should set out a little of the background to the application, explain why you need an order as an emergency, and describe the nature of the order you want. you can nd more information about what to expect in court in leaet cb7.

cb6-eng.txt,"page 1 cb6a guide to explain some words and expressions used in private children cases here are some explanations of some words and expressions that are used in private children cases. private children cases are cases involving disputes about children between individuals. most often that will be the parents, but it may involve another relative or somebody else. court orders are important and they must be complied with. so it is important that you understand what they mean and what they require you to do (or not do). you could get advice from a solicitor or barrister and they will be able to tell you whether you are entitled to legal aid. if you arent, and you cannot afford to get legal advice or representation, there are other advice agencies available, for example the citizens advice. you can also nd useful information at the website www.advicenow.org.uk/advicenow-guides/family/ sorting-out-arrangements-for-your-children/ words in bold are explained elsewhere in the guide. explanations are set out in alphabetical order to help you nd them easily. terms explained allocationwhen an application is made to the family court a judge and/or legal adviser will decide which level of judge should hear it. that will depend on how difcult (complex) the case is. applicantthe person who makes an application to the court is called the applicant. there may be more than one applicant, in which case they may be called the first applicant, second applicant and so on. cb6 - a guide to explain some words and expressions used in private children cases (07.17) crown copyright 2017 page 2 applicationevery case has to start with an application using the correct form. you can nd the forms at http://hmctsformnder.justice.gov.uk/hmcts/formfinder.do and guidance about making an application at www.advicenow.org.uk . there will usually be a fee to pay unless your circumstances mean that you are exempt from paying the fee. ask the court ofce if you think you might be fees exempt. bundlesit is important at hearings that the judge, parties and any witnesses all have the same documents in order so that they can be referred to easily. if that didnt happen everybody at the hearing would have to search around for documents and that would waste time. it is important that bundles (ring binders or arch lever les) are available at the hearing containing the relevant documents for that hearing. if you are a litigant in person the judge will tell you whether you need to prepare a bundle for a hearing. if you do have to prepare a bundle look at practice direction 27a, www.justice.gov.uk/ courts/procedure-rules/family/practice_directions/pd_part_27a which sets out in detail what has to be done. cafcasscafcass (which stands for children and family court advisory and support service) is an independent organisation which supports the family court by giving advice to the court about cases. cafcass may be asked to do a report (usually what is called a section 7 report ). for more information about what cafcass does see their website at www.cafcass.gov.uk care and supervision orders care and supervision orders are not private children orders, however sometimes the court may be concerned in private cases that a child is suffering (or is at risk of suffering) signicant harm. the court may ask a local authority to do a section 37 report and may at the same time make an interim care order. a care order gives parental responsibility to a local authority who can use that to limit the parental responsibility held by parents. under a care order a local authority may place a child with relatives, friends or foster carers so that the child is kept safe. a supervision order requires a local authority to supervise the family for up to 12 months. page 3 child arrangements order a child arrangements order is an order (made under section 8 of the children act 1989 ) which sets out with who a child is to live with and when a child is to live, spend time or otherwise have contact with any person. so the court can make a child arrangements order saying that a child is to live with one parent and see the other at certain times. or the court could say that the child is to live with both parents at certain times. the children act 1989, www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1989/41/contents contains the main provisions relating to children proceedings. most of the parts relating to private law cases are in sections 1 to 16. childrens guardian the court can appoint a guardian to represent children in private children cases. usually the guardian will be a cafcass ofcer, but might also be from nyas (the national youth advocacy service) or some other professional. the court will only appoint a guardian in cases of signicant difculty where it considers the children need to be separately represented. the circumstances in which the court should appoint a guardian are set out in practice direction 16a (paragraph 7.1) www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/family/ practice_directions/pd_part_16a when the court appoints a guardian the child also becomes a party to the case so that he or she can be represented. the guardian will instruct a solicitor to act for the child and legal aid is available for that purpose. the guardians appointment ends when the case is over. contact the court may require a person to make sure that a child spends time or otherwise has contact with another person. usually that will mean the parents, but not necessarily. it could be grandparents or other relatives. contact here means some sort of involvement with the child. that might be direct contact (seeing the child or speaking over the phone or over the web). or it might be indirect contact, for example letters, gifts, cards, school reports and photos. contact activity the court can order a party in the case to take part in an activity designed to improve arrangements for the children involved in the case. currently the activities the court can direct are a mediation information and assessment meeting (miam), the separated parents information programme (spip) and a domestic violence perpetrators programme (dvpp), each of which is described in more detail in this guide. page 4 contact centre contact centres provide a neutral supported place where contact with a child can be re- introduced or kept going, particularly where it might be difcult for contact to happen at home or in the community. the centres are staffed by trained volunteers and staff who will support (but not necessarily directly supervise) contact. you can nd more information at the website of the national association of child contact centres (naccc) www.naccc.org.uk/ dispute resolution appointment a dispute resolution appointment (dra) is the name given to a hearing which takes place shortly before a nal hearing . by the time the dra takes place any reports and witness statements should be available and the court and the parties should therefore know what is going to be said at the nal hearing . the purpose of the dra is to try to resolve or narrow the issues between the parties to the case. sometimes the court might treat the dra as an early nal hearing , hear some evidence and make a nal decision so that the proceedings can be brought to an end as soon as possible. there will not always be time available to do this, so do not expect it to happen. but do be prepared for the possibility. domestic abuse and violence seeing or hearing domestic abuse and violence is very harmful to children. domestic abuse has a very wide meaning. it includes: psychological, physical, sexual, nancial and emotional abuse as well as threatening, controlling and coercive behaviour. domestic violence perpetrators programme (dvpp) dvpps may be used in cases where domestic violence and abuse are a concern. the court may require the perpetrator to attend a group programme designed to help deal with abusive behaviour and to improve relationships. for more information see www.cafcass.gov.uk/about-cafcass/commissioned-services-and-contact-activities/dvpp.aspx drug/alcohol testing in order to decide whether it is safe for a child to live with or see a parent or other adult, the court may need to nd out whether that person is using drugs and/or alcohol. for example, the court may order hair strand or blood tests for a report by a testing laboratory. enforcement if a person disobeys an order the other party may apply to the court for an enforcement order. disobeying prohibited steps or specic issue orders is punishable by imprisonment or ne. in addition, disobeying a child arrangements order can result in unpaid work or nancial compensation . before an order can be enforced in this way it must have included a notice warning the parties that if they do not comply with the order they could page 5 be sent to prison or ned and, in the case of a child arrangements order , made to do unpaid work or pay nancial compensation . these notices are called penal or warning notices. it is more important to make sure people do what court orders say rather than just punish them when they dont. so the court will not send somebody to prison or ne them unless it is a last resort. evidencethe court may need to decide matters that the parties cannot agree about. that may relate to disputed facts (about whether somebody has caused harm, for example) or it may just be a disagreement about what each person believes to be in the best interests of the child (perhaps about where the child should live or go to school). in order to make a decision the court will normally need to hear what the parties say. sometimes the parties may want to bring other people ( witnesses ) to court to support what they are saying. when the court hears from the parties or their witnesses the court is hearing evidence. the court will also take into account witness statements and reports as evidence. when a person gives evidence they are normally required to start by giving an oath on a holy book or by a non-religious afrmation that what they are about to tell the court is the truth. if a person lies under oath they commit the criminal offence of perjury. experts/expert evidencethe court may need to know things which require specialist knowledge or expertise. then the court will need the help of an expert. in a family case that may be a medical expert (for example a paediatrician , psychiatrist or psychologist ) or it may involve drug or alcohol testing or to establish whether somebody is the father of the child (paternity). nobody can rely on an expert without the courts permission which must be applied for in advance. the court will only allow an expert if it is necessary to deal with the case fairly. for more detailed information about what you need to do if you want to rely on an expert see www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/family/parts/part_25 and www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/family/practice_directions/pd_part_25a experts are independent and their rst duty is to the court. fact nding the court may hold what is called a fact nding hearing. this is to decide facts that the parties cannot agree about, for example whether there has been domestic violence or abuse in a relationship. the person who makes an allegation has to prove it, that is show the court that it is more likely than not that it happened (also called the balance of probabilities or the civil standard of proof). page 6 family assistance order the court may decide that the parties (and the children) need help with the arrangements the court has ordered. in that case the court may make a family assistance order (under section 16 of the children act 1989 ) which makes (usually) a cafcass ofcer or social worker responsible for helping the parties to make the arrangements work by advising, assisting and befriending the persons named in the order most often the parents and the child. a family assistance order cannot last longer than 12 months. family court since april 2014 there has been a single family court which deals with all family proceedings, including all private law cases. the family court consists of magistrates (also called lay justices) district judges and circuit judges. cases are allocated to different levels of judge depending on complexity. family procedure rules the family procedure rules, www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/family/rules_pd_menu , are the rules and practice directions which set out what the court and parties must do when dealing with family proceedings. when rules and practice directions are mentioned in this guide, it means the family procedure rules. in particular rule 12 and practice direction 12b relate to private law cases. female genital mutilation protection orders you can apply if you or someone you know is at risk of female genital mutilation. file and serve sometimes you might be told in an order to le and serve something. file means to send to the court and serve means to send to any other parties in the case (and anybody else the order says). final hearingat a nal hearing the court will hope to conclude the proceedings with either an agreement between the parties or an order about any remaining issues or child arrangements. it is important that the case is brought to an end as soon as possible so that the parties can move on and make their parental responsibility work without continuing to look to the court for an answer. the court will not x any more hearings unless it is really necessary and in the interests of the child. page 7 financial compensation order if somebody disobeys a child arrangements order (usually by failing to make sure that a child spends time or has contact with another person) the court may order the person who has failed to comply to pay nancial compensation to the other person, for example for wasted travel or other expenses. first hearing dispute resolution appointment (fhdra) normally the rst hearing the court will hold is called the first hearing dispute resolution appointment. the purpose of that hearing is to try and resolve as many issues as possible. many cases resolve completely at this point. a cafcass ofcer should be on hand to speak to the parties and advise the court. some courts also have a mediator available. if the case does not resolve completely then the court will set what has to happen so that any remaining issues can be dealt with properly. you may hear this referred to as case management or the court giving directions. the court may at this hearing also make short term orders about arrangements for the children (interim orders). otherwise the court might x another hearing for that to be considered (an interim hearing). forced marriage protection orders a forced marriage is one that takes place without the full and free consent of both parties. a forced marriage protection order can help if you are being forced into a marriage or are already in a forced marriage. harmyou may nd the word harm referred to, for example in the welfare checklist and in connection with domestic abuse and violence . it has a very wide meaning in children cases. it means the ill-treatment or impairment of health or development of a child. that includes through seeing or hearing the ill-treatment of somebody else (seeing or hearing domestic violence for example). health means physical and mental health. development means physical, intellectual, emotional, social and behavioural development. ill-treatment includes sexual abuse and non-physical ill-treatment. interpreters if a party or witness is unable to understand spoken english or has a hearing difculty an interpreter may be needed at hearings. if you have a hearing difculty which means that you would not be able to follow the hearing without the help of an interpreter you should let the court know and an interpreter will be arranged for you. page 8 youll be given an interpreter if your case involves children, domestic violence or forced marriage or a female genital protection order . you might still be able to get an interpreter if it doesnt, but only if all of the following apply: you cant afford to pay for an interpreter yourself you dont qualify for legal aid you dont have a friend or family member who the judge says can act as your interpreter see www.justice.gov.uk/courts/interpreter-guidance for more information. lay representative a lay representative is somebody who is not a qualied lawyer but who the court allows to speak on behalf of a party in the case. the court will not usually allow a lay representative because they are not covered by a code of conduct or professional insurance in the same way that qualied lawyers are. that said, the court may consider it if it will help to resolve the case fairly. see also mckenzie friend .legal aid (public funding) since april 2013 legal aid (also called public funding) has been available in private children cases to pay for legal representation only in limited circumstances. usually legal aid will only be given to a party who has been a victim of domestic abuse or violence. in very exceptional cases the legal aid agency (which is the agency responsible for legal aid) may grant exceptional case funding. you can check whether you might be able to get legal aid by visiting the legal aid agency website www.gov.uk/check-legal-aid litigation friendthe court will assume that the parties are able to make their own decisions in relation to the case. if a party cannot make a decision for himself or herself because of some impairment of the mind or brain the court may decide that they need a litigation friend. that may be a friend or relative, provided their interests do not conict with those of the party concerned. otherwise it may be necessary to ask the ofcial solicitor to act as litigation friend. if the court has decided that a party needs a litigation friend, the case cannot proceed without a litigation friend being appointed. the relevant provisions are in: sections 1-3 of the mental capacity act 2005 ( www.legislation.gov.uk/ ukpga/2005/9/contents ) rule 15 ( www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/family/parts/part_15 ) and practice direction 15a ( www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/family/practice_ directions/pd_part_15a ).page 9 parties who need a litigation friend are called protected parties. a child who applies to the court in his or her own right will also need a litigation friend unless the child is old enough and has enough understanding to deal with the case without a litigation friend. sometimes people think that a person who supports them at court is called a litigation friend, which is not strictly correct. that person is more likely to be a mckenzie friend . litigant in persona party in the case who is not represented by a lawyer is a litigant in person. there are no different rules for litigants in person and they are bound by the same rules and procedure as a represented party. the court has a duty to make sure that parties in cases are on an equal footing. the court will try to help litigants in person to ensure a fair hearing. however, the court cannot give advice to a party .mckenzie friend a mckenzie friend is a person who supports a party in a case. there are professional mckenzie friends who may charge a fee for their services. or a mckenzie friend may be a relative, friend or other supporter. either way there are limits on what a mckenzie friend can and cannot do. a mckenzie friend cannot speak at a hearing on your behalf or question witnesses and they cannot conduct the case on your behalf. a mckenzie friend can provide moral support, take notes, help with case papers and quietly give advice. mediation/mediatormediation is a form of non-court dispute resolution done by mediators. it is very important that separated parents and others try to resolve arrangements for children for themselves. using a mediator to help in the process is much better than coming to court, which should be a last resort. you can get more information about mediation from the family mediation council website www.familymediationcouncil.org.uk/family-mediation mediation information and assessment meeting (miam) before you can apply to the court for an order in family cases you must attend a mediation information and assessment meeting (a miam) with a family mediator . the purpose of a miam is to give you information about mediation and to check whether the case might be suitable for mediation. the other party to an application (the respondent ) is also expected to attend but does not have to (although the court might order that later on). there are cases where the requirement to attend a miam does not apply, for example cases involving domestic violence or urgent cases , but you need to check carefully whether that applies to you. the rules are strictly applied. page 10 you can get more information about miams at the website of the family mediation council (fmc) www.familymediationcouncil.org.uk/family-mediation/assessment-meeting-miam/ where you can also nd details of family mediators in your area authorised to do miams. also here is a link to a short video about mediation, www.familymediationcouncil.org.uk/ family-mediation/ monitoring orders the court may ask cafcass to keep a check on (monitor) child arrangements that have been ordered by the court, particularly at the end of a difcult case. cafcass will report back to the court if the order is not kept to. no order principle the courts should not impose outcomes on adults concerning children if the adults can resolve matters for themselves. as a result the starting position is that the court will not make an order unless it is better for the child to do so. if there has been a difcult argument over arrangements for a child resulting in the court having to make a decision, it may be that it is better for the child for the court to make an order to ensure as far as possible that what has been decided actually happens. but in very many cases it is enough to note what the parties have agreed and an order is simply not needed. non-court dispute resolution this refers to any type of resolution of issues that adults have about children that takes place away from the court (most often mediation but it may be counselling or therapy or some other form of help). ofcial solicitorif a party to proceedings needs a litigation friend and there is nobody else available the ofcial solicitor may be asked to act as litigation friend . for more information see the website for the ofcial solicitor, www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ofcial-solicitor- and-public-trustee paediatrician a paediatrician is a medical doctor who specialises in the health and development of children. a paediatrician may be asked to help the court by providing a report or giving expert evidence .parental responsibility legally parental responsibility is all the rights, duties, powers, responsibilities and authority that a parent of a child has. the most important aspect of parental responsibility though is responsibility rather than rights. page 11 mothers always have parental responsibility. fathers will have it automatically if they are named on the childs birth certicate (since december 2003). they may also get it by agreement with the mother or order of the court. some child arrangement orders also result in parental responsibility being held by parents or others while the order is in force. parental responsibility is very important. part of that responsibility is about separated parents making sure that they are able to make satisfactory arrangements for their children that are in their interests. it is, in short, the job of bringing up children. party the word party or parties is used in this guide and you will see it in orders. this means those who apply to the court (the applicant ) and those who are entitled to be heard by the court in response (the respondent ). sometimes a child may be party to proceedings, either in his or her own right if the child is of sufcient age and understanding, or because the court has appointed a childrens guardian .penal notice see enforcement permission to apply some people are entitled to apply for orders about children the parents obviously and some people with whom a child has lived for a certain length of time. others must get the courts permission before applying for an order. this is dealt with in section 10 of the children act 1989, www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1989/41/section/10 personal service sometimes the rules or the court will say that documents in the case must be personally served. this means that they have to be handed personally to the person who is to be served rather than sent by post. normally it is better if you do not try to personally serve documents yourself. you could ask a process server to do it for you. they will make a statement conrming whether they have been able to personally serve the documents. otherwise the court might ask the court bailiff to deal with it. prohibited steps order the court may make an order prohibiting a person from doing something in relation to a child, for example, removing the child from a parent or from school or changing a childs name. this is called a prohibited steps order. failing to obey it may result in a ne or imprisonment. see also specic issue orders .page 12 psychiatrist psychiatrists specialise in the diagnosis and treatment of mental illness and disorders. some psychiatrists deal with adults, others with children and adolescents. a psychiatrist may be asked to help the court by providing a report or giving expert evidence about any mental illness and risks that might result for children. psychologist a psychologist specialises in peoples behaviour and mental processes. a psychologist may be asked to help the court by providing a report or giving expert evidence about the behaviour of the parties and how that affects the matters the court has to decide. respondent when somebody applies to the court certain other people are entitled to know about the application and to become a party so they can respond. those people are known as respondents. everybody with parental responsibility will automatically be a respondent. the court may also decide that other people concerned about the child should become respondents so that the court can hear what they have to say. right to apply if a hearing has taken place without you knowing about it (for example because of urgency or a risk of harm ) you have a right to ask the court to reconsider any order made at that hearing (called a right to apply). you must act promptly and ask the court in writing to reconsider the order (usually by the judge or magistrates who made the order). the court may arrange another hearing for that to be done. you must tell the other party in the case that you have asked the court to reconsider the order. see also without notice .safeguarding at the start of the case cafcass will ask the police and any local authorities for the areas where the parties live or have lived recently to provide any information they have. this may include any criminal records held by the police or child protection or other information held by a local authority. the court should not make an order about children without safeguarding information unless the case is an urgent one requiring an immediate order. section 7 report the court may ask cafcass or a local authority to do a report for the court about a childs circumstances and to make a recommendation to the court about the sorts of orders that it should make. this report is prepared under section 7 of the children act 1989 and it should take into account the welfare checklist .page 13 section 37 report the court may think that a child is at possible risk of harm such that the local authority might consider making an application to the court for a care or supervision order . the court can ask a local authority to report under section 37 of the children act 1989 whether it intends to apply for a care or supervision order . at the same time the court may make an interim (short term) care order .if the local authority is not going to apply for a care or supervision order it should tell the court what support (if any) it intends giving the family concerned. separated parents information programme (spip) spips are designed to help parents learn more about the effect on their children of separation. they are a form of activity ordered by the court, although in some areas spips may be available before proceedings start (the sooner parents go on such a programme after separation the better). for more information see the cafcass website, www.cafcass.gov.uk/about-cafcass/ commissioned-services-and-contact-activities/spip.aspx . there is also a short video about spips on youtube. short noticesometimes an application to the court may be considered so urgent that the usual period of notice cannot be given to the respondent . even so, the court will want to give the respondent an opportunity to be heard and may shorten the usual notice so that can be done. this is called giving short notice. special guardian the court can appoint a special guardian or guardians for a child. special guardians have parental responsibility for the child which they can use to the exclusion of parental responsibility held by anybody else, including the parents. so a special guardian will be able to decide about a childs upbringing even if a parent disagrees (although that parent could still apply to the court to decide what was in the childs best interests). some people are entitled to apply for a special guardianship order, others need permission to apply . first though three months written notice has to be given to the local authority for the area where the child lives so they can prepare a detailed report for the court about the suitability of the applicant(s) .page 14 specic issue order a specic issue order sets out what must be done in relation to a child, for example, which school the child must attend or which last name he or she will be known by. if you think of a prohibited steps order as saying what people cannot do in relation to a child, a specic issue order tells them what they must do. statements see witnesses/witness statements supervised/supported contactsometimes contact between a child and another person needs to be supervised or supported. supervision means somebody keeping a close eye on the contact and being present throughout. the supervisor may be somebody known to the parties (a trusted friend or relative for example) or a professional person at a centre that provides for supervised contact . the court will only order contact to be supervised if necessary to protect the interests of a child. supported contact does not require constant supervision. it is normally provided at a contact centre as a way to help re-introduce contact over a short period. unpaid work order if it is proved that a party has not done what they are required to do by a child arrangements order the court can order them to do unpaid work for between 40 and 200 hours. this is also known as an enforcement order . the court will ask cafcass to provide information to decide whether it would be appropriate to make an unpaid work order (including the availability of such work locally). unlawful removal/ child abduction it is a serious criminal offence to remove a child from the uk without the agreement of everybody with parental responsibility or permission of the court. most countries to which a child is unlawfully removed will normally order the childs immediate return. if you are concerned that a child has been unlawfully removed you should take urgent advice from a solicitor. here is a link to further information about child abduction, www.gov.uk/government/publications/international-parental-child-abduction page 15 urgent cases sometimes applications are made to the court without the applicant going to a miam rst. an urgent hearing may also be asked for. of course anybody applying to the court is likely to feel that their case is urgent but the rules are clear as to what urgent really means. a case is only urgent if there is: a risk to the life, liberty or physical safety of the applicant or his or her family or home or delay would cause a risk of harm to a child a risk of unlawful removal of a child from the uk a signicant risk of a miscarriage of justice unreasonable hardship to the applicant irretrievable problems in dealing with the dispute (for example loss of signicant evidence). warning notice see enforcement welfare of the child the courts overriding concern when dealing with a child case is the welfare of the child (sometimes called the childs best interests). the court will consider the welfare checklist . it is also important when adults (including courts) make decisions about children that they listen to what the child is saying (the voice of the child). the court will need to consider how the child is to be involved in a case. much will of course depend on the age and understanding of the child. it may be enough for the child to be seen by a cafcass ofcer who can report the childs wishes and feelings to the court. or the child may want to be more directly involved for example by writing a letter or seeing the judge. sometimes the court will want the child to be separately represented by a childrens guardian .the court will also take into account that delay in dealing with the case is likely to be harmful to the child concerned. the court will x a timetable to avoid any unnecessary delay. page 16 welfare checklist when deciding what is in the best interests of a child, the court will take into account the welfare checklist in section 1(3) of the children act 1989 :the ascertainable wishes and feelings of the child given his age and level of understanding his physical, educational and emotional needs the likely effect on him of any change of circumstances his age, sex, background and other relevant characteristics any harm he is suffering or is at risk of suffering how capable the parents/adults concerned are of meeting his needs the powers the court has. witness/witness statementsa witness is somebody who gives evidence to the court. a party is a witness when giving evidence . a party may call somebody else to give evidence on their behalf and they will be witnesses. anybody who is going to give evidence to the court must make a written statement of what they are going to say. the court order will set out what has to be done. the parties themselves may nd it helpful to use the witness statement template available online http://hmctsformnder.justice.gov.uk/courtnder/forms/c120-eng.pdf without noticenormally the court will not make any decisions without giving both sides a chance to be heard. exceptionally the court may be prepared to make an order without notice to one party , but only if: giving notice would enable to the other party to take steps to defeat the purpose of the order or there is exceptional urgency, that is there has been literally no time to give notice even by telephone, text or email or if notice is given it would expose the applicant or child to an unnecessary risk of physical or emotional harm .if the court does make an order without notice a further hearing will be arranged to give an opportunity for the other party to be heard. also if you were not given notice of a hearing you can ask the court to reconsider any order made see right to apply .", the case to take part in an activity designed

in certain circumstances, to compensate for past or future lost earnings or special expenses caused by a violent crime; and the information you provide must be complete, accurate and clear. in all cases you will need to use either the personal-injury or the fatal-injury application form. compensating victims of violent crime 5for the death of a close relative as a result of a violent crime, including, in some cases, compensation for the lost earnings oftheperson who was killed. 9the scheme deals with injuries suffered in great britain that is, england, scotland and wales. northern ireland has its own scheme. the criminal injuries compensation authority and the organisation it replaced (the criminal injuries compensation board) have run the scheme since the first version was introduced in 1964. this makes the british system of criminal injuries compensation the oldest in theworld. it is also the largest, with awards totalling more than 200million every year. 10for applications made before 1 april 1996, the scheme was based on the common law. cases were assessed in the same way that personal injury claims were dealt with in the civil courts. in 1996, thesystem changed when the tariff of injuries was introduced. thetariff is a list of fixed compensation payments for each injury. the 1996 scheme was changed in 2001, but the new scheme continues to use a tariff of injuries. 11we are responsible for running the scheme, but not for the rules it contains. the scheme was developed by the home secretary and approved by parliament, and both the 1996 and 2001 schemes wereset up under an act of parliament the criminal injuries compensation act 1995. 12in general, you do not need legal advice or representation to apply for compensation. if you do decide to get legal or other paid advice to help with your application, we cannot pay the costs of this. if you are considering getting a solicitor they need to be a reputable one, and there are costs to think about, particularly on complex claims. the independent charity victim support, which provides services to victims throughout great britain, can provide free, confidential emotional and practical support. victim support can provide information about the scheme, and can help you to fill in the application form. the phone number of your nearest victim support branch will be in the phone book, or you can get it (and other information) by: phoning the victim supportline on 0845 30 30 900; visiting the website at www.victimsupport.org; or e-mailing supportline@victimsupport.org.uk victim support cannot provide legal advice. 13you can also get advice from your local citizens advice bureau or law centre, or from a welfare rights organisation. if you belong to atrade union, they may be able to help. the main rules of the scheme 14the main rules of the scheme are set out in the following paragraphs but this is a very brief statement of them. you will find a more detailed explanation in the later parts of this guide, which you should read with the scheme. the scheme deals with injuries suffered in great britain that is, england, scotland and wales. northern ireland has its own scheme. in general, you do not need legal advice or representation to apply for compensation. we cannot pay the costs of legal advice. 6compensating victims of violent crime part 1 15we will consider your application if you: have been physically or mentally injured (or both) as a direct resultof a violent crime, or of some other incident covered by thescheme (it is not necessary for an offender to be convicted of, or even charged with, the crime); were in great britain (england, scotland or wales) when you wereinjured; and have been injured seriously enough to qualify for at least the minimum award that we will pay under the scheme. (the tariff levels are set out in full at the end of the scheme and details aregiven in part 5 of this guide.) these rules are explained in more detail in part 3 of thisguide. 16we cannot consider your application under this scheme if: you were injured before 1 august 1964; you have already applied for compensation for the same criminal injury, whether under the 2001 scheme or under any earlier scheme operating in great britain; or the injury happened before 1 october 1979 and you and the person who injured you were living together at the time as members of the same family in the same household. we must follow these rules and cannot take account of individual circumstances. 17even if you meet the tests above, we have to consider whether to refuse or reduce an award because of: your behaviour before, during or after the incident in which you were injured; your criminal record; or your failure to co-operate with the police or with us. these rules are explained in more detail in part 4 of thisguide. 18you should also have: reported the incident personally to the police as soon as you were able to do so; and sent us your application so that we received it within two years of the date of the incident which caused the injury. if you can show good reasons why you have not met one or both conditions, we may still be able to accept your application. 19if your application and our enquiries show that you are entitled to an award, we will assess the size of that award by using the tariff of injuries. part5 of this guide explains the tariff and how we apply it. 20you may also be able to get additional compensation if, as a result ofa violent crime, you have lost earnings or the ability to earn for compensating victims of violent crime 7you should report the incident to the police yourself, within 48 hours if possible. longer than 28 weeks. in these circumstances, you may qualify for compensation for the earnings you have lost and for any special expenses for example, medical, dental or eye treatment. (we cannot pay lost earnings for the first 28 weeks of loss. we can pay special expenses from the date of the injury, but only if you have lost earnings or the ability to earn for more than 28 weeks). you should let us know if you think you qualify for additional compensation, and we will send you separate guides and application forms. 21you may also be eligible for compensation if you were a dependant or a close relative of a victim of a violent crime in great britain who has since died. the rules for this are explained in a separate guide and you will need to fill in a separate fatal-injury application form. making an application22general the personal-injury application form contains notes to help you fill it in. you can also fill in the form online at www.cica.gov.uk. the online version provides prompts and advice to help you fill it in. it is important that you give us all reasonable help and information that is relevant to your application. you can help us to process your claim quickly and efficiently if you provide full information (such as the police crime reference number and the correct name and address of your gp and any hospital where you were treated). we may have toreturn the form to you if it is not complete or accurate, which willslow the whole process down considerably. and, if you fail to provide full or accurate information, we may have to reduce or refuseany award because you failed to co-operate with us. 23by signing the application form, you are giving us permission to receive all the records, evidence and other information about you and the circumstances of your injury which will help us to make the right decision about your application. this includes information on your medical condition, the evidence you have given the police, a criminal records check and may also include (if you are claiming for lost earnings or special expenses) information about your income, tax and benefits situation. sometimes, we may ask you for permission to collect specific confidential information which we need. this may arise if, for example, a doctor who has treated you wants to be sure that you have agreed to them giving us certain information. naturally, we keepall the information we receive strictly confidential. 24applying on behalf of a child if the application arises from child abuse, ask us for the separate leaflet child abuse and the criminal injuries compensation scheme . more generally, if you are applying on behalf of someone who is under 18, you should normally be an adult with parental responsibility for the child (that is, the natural or adoptive parent or another person with legal parental responsibility). you mustenclose the childs original birth certificate with the application form. you must send us a full, original birth certificate if your surname is different to that of the child, unless youare a representative of a by signing the application form you give us permission to ask for and receive information about you. 8compensating victims of violent crime part 1 local authority. (the full birth certificate is the long, a4-sized version which names the parents. you can get it from the registrar of births, deaths and marriages.) we recommend that you send the full version even if your surname is the same as that of the child. 25if the child is in care, we will expect the local authority to apply for compensation if they have parental responsibility. the application (and any later applications for review or appeal) should be signed by someone who is authorised to do so on behalf of the local authority, and a copy of the care order should be provided. in other cases, we will expect the person who has parental responsibility for the child to apply and sign the application. 26if no-one is legally entitled to act for the child, you should get help from the official solicitor to apply in england and wales. if you are inscotland, a tutor or guardian may need to be appointed. we do notmake these arrangements ourselves. wherever possible, all necessary formalities should be completed on the childs behalf before an application is made, so that there are no delays later on. but if the incident that you are claiming for happened some time ago,you should send us the application as quickly as possible. 27you should get advice if you are not sure who is responsible for the child, for example from your local citizens advice bureau. 28adults who cannot manage their own affairs if you are applying on behalf of an adult who is legally not capable of managing his or her own affairs, we may appoint you to act as their representative for the purpose of the application if we think youare suitable. this will allow you to: authorise all our enquiries; decide whether to accept an award; ask for a review; or appeal to the criminal injuries compensation appeals panel. before we do this, we will need medical evidence that the person youare representing is incapable by reason of mental disorder, asdefined in the mental health act 1983, of managing his or her property and affairs. how we will deal with your application 29when we receive your filled-in application form, we will give you a personal reference number which will help us to identify it quickly ifyou need to contact us. if you apply online, as well as your personal reference number we will send you a signature authorisation page to print, sign and return to us. we cannot deal with your claim until we receive this signed page. we will then contact the police and, if we need to, your doctor or the hospital that treated you, and any other organisations or people with relevant information about your claim. 30we will deal with the case in what is called the claims assessment section of the authority. the person at the authority who you are likely to deal with most is your caseworker. compensating victims of violent crime 9once we have received your application we will work closely with the police, medical and other relevant authorities where appropriate to gather more information about your case as quickly as possible. 31we will start making enquiries before we pass your case to a caseworker. for example, as soon as your case is registered we immediately start gathering information from the police and medical authorities to check whether you are eligible for an award. 32it may take some time to gather this information but we work closely with the police and medical authorities to get this as quickly as possible. in certain circumstances this may involve asking for information several times but we are always working to reduce the time it takes to get the information we need. 33at the moment, reaching a final decision on your claim can take a year or more depending on how complex your case is. in most cases, this will be a decision about whether or not you are eligible for an award plus, as appropriate, the amount of the award. some cases, for example, those involving future loss of earnings or future medical expenses, will usually take longer than a year to settle. this is because of the difficulty of gathering information from employers and medical specialists, and the difficulty of predicting future career prospects and medical needs. however, where appropriate, we will try to make interim payments. if we have made such payments, we will take them off the final award. 34when your case is ready to be decided, the caseworker will pass it to a more senior officer, called a claims officer. claims officers are responsible for assessing whether an award should be made and, if so, the amount and how it should be paid. as soon as the decision has been made, the claims officer will write to tell you or your representative what it is. if we have reduced or refused an award, we will tell you why. 35if you disagree with our decision, you are entitled to ask for a more senior officer within the authority to review it. we send applicants a review form and a guide to review procedures when we issue the original decision. the review procedures are set out in paragraphs 58 to 60 of the scheme. please also see paragraph 17 of part 2 of this guide. 36if you want to appeal against the review decision, you are entitled to appeal to the criminal injuries compensation appeals panel, which is independent of the authority. we will send you an appeal form and a guide to appeal procedures when we issue the review decision. paragraphs 61 to 82 of the scheme deal with the appeal system. please also see paragraph 18 of part 2 of this guide. 37we may sometimes need to make special arrangements for paying an award, to take account of the circumstances of the victim or other relevant issues. for example, if the victim is a child and there is a risk that any award paid to his or her parents would not be used for the childs benefit, to protect the childs interests we may set up a trust, or invest the money in an account that earns interest until he or she reaches 18. reaching a final decision on your claim can take a year or more depending on how complex your case is. if you disagree with our decision, you can ask us to review it. if you disagree with the review decision, you can appeal to the independent criminal injuries compensation appeals panel. 10compensating victims of violent crime part 1 our standards of service 38you can expect us to deal with your application politely and confidentially. we will write to you with our decision as quickly as possible. we do rely on other organisations to reply to our enquiries and we work closely with them to get the information we need as quickly as possible. 39in particular, we aim to do the following. acknowledge your application and send out routine enquiry forms to the police within seven days of receiving your application (as long as it is complete). to find out, as soon as possible, if you are eligible for an award. this will usually be when we receive police information about your case. then, if we need to, we will send out routine enquiry forms to the medical authorities. in complex cases, where it may take some time to decide the final amount of compensation, we will look to make interim payments as soon as we can. if you decide to ask for a review of our decision, we will acknowledge your application for a review within seven days of receiving it. once we have received your application for a review, we will look at your claim again and where appropriate, make further enquiries. reaching a decision generally takes many months and more complex cases can take over a year to decide. if you appeal against the decision made at review, the appeals process usually takes a year or more depending on how complex your claim is. complaints40if you are not satisfied with the decision in your case, you may apply for

legal document and is fairly complicated it sets out the rules under which large amounts of public money are paid out. but its basic structure is not difficult. we have briefly described it in the following paragraphs and more detailed explanations of particularly important or complicated areas of the scheme are in the following parts of the guide. 2paragraphs 1 to 5 of the scheme are introductory . they will not generally be crucial to people applying, but it is worth noting the phrase claims officer in paragraphs 2 and 3. claims officers are the people in the authority who assess applications and decide on awards. 3paragraphs 6 to 12 of the scheme set out the main types of incident and injury for which we may be able to award compensation . the injury may be mental as well as physical. you should read these paragraphs carefully if you are thinking of applying for an award. part3 of this guide explains them in more detail. 4paragraphs 13 to 17 of the scheme set out the circumstances in which, even if the conditions in paragraphs 6 to 12 of the scheme are met, we may refuseor reduce an award . theparagraphs cover issues suchas the behaviour and criminal record of the person applying, his or her level of co-operation with the police, and whether there is a danger of an offender benefiting from an award. these paragraphs are very important. part4 of this guide explains them inmore detail. 5paragraphs 18 to 22 of the scheme describe how and when you should apply for compensation and how claims officers must decide them . part 5 of this guide explains the main points on the time limit for applications and on the standard of proof which claims officers must look for. 6paragraph 23 of the scheme summarises the types of compensation which people may apply for . the various types are described in more detail in paragraphs 26 to 44 of the scheme. paragraphs 24 and 25 of the scheme set out the upper and lower limits of compensation fora particular incident 500,000 and 1,000. these paragraphs, along with paragraphs 26 to 29 of the scheme, are also explained inmore detail in part 5 ofthis guide. 7paragraphs 26 to 29 of the scheme set out the formula for working out awards for injuries under the tariff. the tariff lists injury descriptions and the levels of compensation we can pay for each of them. compensation ranges from1,000 to paragraphs 6 to 12 of the scheme set out the main types of incident and injury for which we may be able to award compensation. awards may range from 1,000 to 500,000. 14compensating victims of violent crime 250,000, depending on how serious the injury is . (the upperlimit of 500,000 for a total award includes compensation for financial loss on top of the tariff award.) the tariff is set out in full at the end of the scheme. 8paragraphs 30 to 36 of the scheme set out the conditions under which you may claim additional compensation if you have lost earnings or the ability to earn (paragraphs 30 to 34 of the scheme) or for other special expenses dueto the criminal injury (paragraphs 35 and 36 of the scheme) . these conditions are explained in separate guides, which also provide information on how these losses should be worked out and claimed. the basic rule is that we cannot award compensation for lost earnings or special expenses (including, for example, the cost of dental work if your teeth or mouth have been injured) unless your injury means that you have not been able to work for at least 28 weeks. there are also separate application forms for compensation under these headings. please let us know if you think that you may be eligible for these types of compensation and we will send you a copy of these guides and forms. 9paragraphs 37 to 44 of the scheme set out the conditions under which compensation may be applied for and paid when the victim of a crime has died after receiving a criminal injury . thereis also a separate guide and application form for these cases. you should let us know if you are thinking of applying under this heading and we will send them to you. 10an injury may lead to you becoming entitled to receive more state orother benefits . we will pay the tariff part of the award the award simply for having suffered the injury even if you are entitled to other benefits. but we will reduce any additional compensation, such as loss of earnings or care costs, to take account of other relevant payments that you may be entitled to .this is to avoid the possibility of you receiving two payments from public funds. paragraphs 45 to47 of the scheme setout how we do this. these paragraphs are explained in more detail in the separate guides mentioned above. 11under paragraphs 48 and 49 of the scheme, we will reduce the full award, including the tariff award, to take account of all payments of compensation or damages thata court awarded for the same injuries. if you receive payments from a court after receiving our award, you must pay us back the amount we awarded to you. 12paragraphs 50 to 52 of the scheme contain important technical rulesabout deciding applications and paying awards , including the circumstances in which we may pay awards inthe form of a trust, a lump sum or an annuity (that is, a regular payment from an insurance policy bought with the award). under paragraph50 of the scheme, we must tell you our decision in writing, including the reasons for reducing or refusing an award. we cannot pay compensation for lost earnings and expenses unless you have not been able to work for at least 28 weeks. part 2 compensating victims of violent crime 1513wherever possible, we settle applications by offering a single payment of compensation a final award. but we can do this only ifyour medical condition and financial losses are clear. if there is likely to be a long delay in getting this information, but it is clear that you are eligible for compensation, we may make one or more interim payments (paragraph 51 of the scheme). 14if it is likely that we will award you a lot of money, you may choose to receive the award in the form of an annuity or annuities. these are commonly known as structured settlements and can provide tax-free payments that keep pace with inflation. you or your representatives can tell us which annuity policy to buy and we will take our expenses for doing this from the award (paragraph52 of the scheme). 15under paragraphs 53 to 55, claims officers may reconsider their decisions at any time before a final award has been made. 16paragraphs 56 and 57 of the scheme deal with the separate issue of reopening cases, aftera final decision has been made and accepted, for medical reasons . this is rare, and can happen only if: your medical condition has substantially deteriorated in a way that was not expected when we made the decision; and it would be unfair for our decision to stand. also, if it is more than two years since we made the decision, we canreopen the case only if we can do so without needing to carry out thorough new enquiries. we may agree to reopen a case if: injuries which seemed to be minor at the time are now serious enough to qualify for an award; you would now qualify for an award from a higher tariff band; or your medical condition has become so much worse that you can no longer work. we will not reopen a case if there is no chance of the result being a higher award. we will usually expect you to provide medical evidence to support the request to reopen the case. 17paragraphs 58 to 60 of the scheme set out what happens if you disagree with the original decision and want us to review it . we can review any of the main decisions that a claims officer made (paragraph 58 of the scheme). we must receive a written application for a review within 90 days of the date of the original decision, unless you have asked us to extend this period within the 90days and it is in the interests of justice to grant an extension (paragraph 59 of the scheme). a claims officer who is more senior than the one who made the original decision will review the decision, and will look at the whole application again. this means that the reviewed decision can be more favourable or less favourable than the original decision, or the original decision may not be changed if it is clear that you are eligible for compensation, we may make one or more interim payments. if you think a decision is wrong, you may ask us to review it. a reviewed decision can be more favourable or less favourable than the original decision.16compensating victims of violent crime (paragraph 60 of the scheme). so, we may withdraw or reduce an award that we previously offered if, for instance, we have new information (such as a new criminal conviction) at the review stage, or if the officer carrying out the review thinks that the earlier decision was wrong. 18paragraphs 61 to 82 of the scheme set out what happens if you disagree with a review decision. in these cases, youmay appeal to the independent criminal injuries compensation appeals panel . when we send you the review decision, we will send you aform to use to ask for an appeal. you will need to fill in the form, including reasons why you are appealing and any extra material, and send it to the appeals panel (not to us) so that they receive it within 90 days of the date of the review decision. as with the review, you may ask the appeals panel to extend this period and it may be granted if it is in the interests of justice to do so. the address of theappeals panel is: criminal injuries compensation appeals panel 11th floor cardinal tower 12 farringdon road london ec1m 3hs. phone:020 7549 4600 19at appeal hearings, one of our presenting officers presents the case but the appeals panel makes the decision. the members and staff of the appeals panel are entirely independent of us and consider the whole application again. the appeals panel may make a decision which is more favourable or less favourable than the review decision, or the review decision can stay the same. the appeals panels decision is final. 20this part of the scheme sets out important details of the appeal process, including rules governing oral hearings, the role of the panel chairman and single adjudicators, and the types of decision which you can appeal against. these procedures are explained in more detail in the separate guide to appeal procedures which we send out with the review decision and appeal application form. the appeals panel also gives people who have appealed a guide called your panel hearing. 21paragraphs 83 to 86 of the scheme cover how and when the 2001 scheme came into force. in general, we deal with all applications which we received on or after 1april 2001 under this scheme . the main exceptions are as follows: in cases where the victim of the crime has died and the person applying is the victims same-sex partner, the 2001 scheme will apply if the injuries were suffered on or after 1 april 2001, rather than if the application was received on or after that date. if you disagree with the review decision, you may appeal to the independent criminal injuries compensation appeals panel. the appeals panel is independent of us. it considers applications again. part 2 compensating victims of violent crime 17if a case which has already been settled is reopened for medical reasons (paragraph 56 of the scheme), we will deal with the case under the scheme which was in force when the original case was settled. so, for example, if your case was originally settled in 1994under the terms of the 1990 compensation scheme, we will reassess it under the terms of the 1990 scheme. 22the scheme itself is followed by three notes . as explained above and in part 4 of this guide, paragraph 8 of the scheme says that compensation may be paid if the criminal injury was suffered ingreat britain. notes 1 and 2 define great britain for the purposes ofthe scheme .23note 3 is relevant if we are going to make a lump-sum award covering future loss of earnings, future care costs or future dependency (the last of these applies when the victim has died from a criminal injury and his or her dependants want compensation for loss of financial support). we use the tables shown in the note to work outthe size of this lump sum . thetables are explained in the separate guide which we will send to you if you ask us. 24note 3 is followed by the table showing the levels of compensation, ranging from level 1 (1,000) to level 25 (250,000). every type of injury listed in the tariff of injuries attracts one of these levels of compensation. 25the tariff of injuries follows this at the end of the scheme .appendix 1 to this guide is a glossary of some of the medical terms used in the tariff. the tariff includes 11 self-explanatory notes notes 4 to 14 .where and when did the incident happen?

cic-guide-2001-eng.txt,"1the phrases criminal injury and crime of violence are central to the scheme, but both are more complicated than they appear to be at first. this part of the guide sets out some of the issues involved. 2to qualify for compensation under this scheme, you must have suffered the injury in great britain or one of the other places set out in notes 1 and 2 of the scheme (pages 18 and 19 of the scheme). we cannot pay compensation for injuries you suffered elsewhere, forexample on holiday abroad, although compensation may be available under a similar scheme that is in force in the country concerned. (if you have access to the internet, you can find a list ofcountries which have a crime victim compensation scheme at www.ojp.usdoj.gov/ovc/intdir/intdir.htm). if you suffered the injury in northern ireland, you are not eligible to apply under this scheme. northern ireland has its own scheme and you should get details from: the compensation agency royston house 34 upper queen street belfast bt1 6fd. phone:02890 249944 3we may pay compensation even if the offender is not convicted ofthe crime causing your injury and even if the offender is not identified or caught. 4we cannot pay compensation if you: were injured before 1 august 1964; have previously applied for compensation for the same injury under this or any earlier scheme operating in great britain; or were injured before 1october 1979 and you and the person whoinjured you were living together at the time as members of thesame family in the same household (paragraphs 6 and 7 of thescheme). 5the reason for the 1964 rule is that the first scheme came into force then so it has never been possible to pay compensation for injuries suffered earlier. the reason for the 1979 rule is rather similar. until 1979, it was not possible to receive any compensation for injuries suffered if you and the person who injured you were living together part 3: defining criminal injury and crime of violence (paragraphs 6 to 12 of the scheme) we cannot pay compensation for injuries suffered abroad. we may pay compensation even if the offender is not convicted and, in some cases, even if the offender is not caught. 18compensating victims of violent crime part 3 at the time as members of the same family. this was mainly to prevent the possibility of the offender benefiting from compensation in these circumstances. the rule was changed in 1979, but only for injuries suffered from 1 october 1979. the nature and circumstances of the criminal injury 6to qualify for compensation, you must have suffered a physical ormental injury (or both) that is serious enough to be included in oneof the tariff bands attached to the scheme. any criminal injury willbe serious to the person who suffered it. but the lowest level of compensation we can award is 1,000, which means that we cannot provide compensation for less serious injuries, such as scratches orbruises. on the other hand, you may qualify if you have suffered a combination of minor injuries (as shown in note 12 in the tariff) from which you did not recover for atleast six weeks and which caused you to visit your doctor at least twice during that six-week period . paragraphs 26 and 27of part 5 of this guide explain this rule morefully. 7the tariff award for the physical injury includes an element of compensation for the mental injury which you would normally experience as a result of suffering that physical injury. if you are to receive a separate award for mental injury, you must show that the mental injury you suffered was clearly greater than would normally be expected. in most circumstances, you can receive compensation for mental injury only if you also suffered a physical injury. 8also, in all cases where you are applying for compensation for mental injury, it will need to be properly diagnosed by: a doctor (such as your gp) if you want compensation for shock (what the scheme calls temporary mental anxiety ); or a psychiatrist or psychologist if you want compensation for a more serious mental injury. 9there are two situations in which you might qualify for an award arising from mental injury alone, without a physical injury. the first isif you suffered a mental injury because you were reasonably in fear of immediate physical harm to yourself. the second is if your mental injury was caused by someone very close to you suffering acriminal injury. 10in the second case, you will need to show that you suffered the injurybecause you either witnessed and were present at an incident, orwere closely involved in the immediate aftermath of an incident, where a person with whom you had a close relationship of love andaffection was physically or mentally injured (paragraph9 of thescheme). witnessed and were present should be fairly simple to decide. but it is not possible to set definite rules on the meaning of the alternative immediate aftermath test or what is a close relationship of love and affection . we have to look at each case individually. the lowest level of compensation we can award is 1,000. compensating victims of violent crime 1911we may offer you compensation even if the injuries were caused by someone who could not be held responsible under criminal law, for example, because he or she was mentally ill or too young (paragraph 10 of the scheme). also, it is not necessary for the person who injured you to be convicted or even caught. but we need reliable evidence, onthe balance of probabilities (that it is more likely than not), that you suffered a criminal injury. the meaning of criminal injury and crime ofviolence is considered in the paragraphs below. the issue of the balance of probabilities is considered in part 5 of this guide. 12we can offer you compensation only for injuries directly resulting from a violent crime or threat of violence. this means we must be satisfied that the incident caused your injury, and that the injury was not due to some other event. you will not qualify for an award if your only injury is a mental injury resulting from the loss of or damage to belongings following a crime, such as burglary, which did not involve violence. the meaning of criminal injury and crime of violence 13introduction the main rules on what counts as a criminal injury or a crime of violence are in paragraph 8 of the scheme, with further points in paragraphs 9 to12 of the scheme. 14there is no legal definition of the term crime of violence . it will usuallyinvolve a physical attack on the person, for example, an assault, a wounding or a sexual offence. however, this is not always so and we judge each case individually. in some circumstances, we may also consider the threat of violence to be a violent crime. 15the following paragraphs in this part of the guide discuss what is and what is not covered by the phrases crime of violence and criminal injury . 16arson if you were injured as a direct result of a crime of arson, you may be entitled to an award. if you were accidentally injured while fighting a fire resulting from an arson attack, or dealing with the consequences of it, you may qualify if you were taking an exceptional risk . if, for example, you are a firefighter who attended a fire resulting from anarson attack and you tripped over a hose, you are not likely to receive any compensation. but if you were injured in dangerous circumstances inside a burning building and your behaviour was justifiable, we may consider this to be an exceptional risk for which you may receive compensation (paragraphs 8(a) and 12 of the scheme, and see paragraphs 18 and 19 below about the meaning of exceptional risk ).17preventing an offence if you were injured while you were trying to catch an offender orasuspected offender, or were helping a police officer to catch anoffender, you may be entitled to an award. the conditions on exceptional risk apply in this case too see below (paragraphs 8(c)and 12 of the scheme). we need reliable evidence that you suffered a criminal injury. we cannot compensate you for the trauma of burglary. 20compensating victims of violent crime part 3 18exceptional risk (paragraph 12 of the scheme) if you were injured while you were dealing with an arson attack or preventing an offence, we can pay compensation only if, at the time you were injured, you were taking a risk which was both exceptional and justifiedin all the circumstances. whether the risk was justifiedwill depend on the circumstances of the incident for example, howserious the situation that you were dealing with was and how immediate the threat was. whether the risk was exceptional willdepend on the circumstances in which it was taken for example, theweather and the time of day or night, and whether you were equipped to deal with it. 19for example, if you are a police officer who had tripped in the street in broad daylight when chasing an offender, you are not likely to receive compensation. similarly, climbing over a wall or a fence would not usually be considered an exceptional risk. but an action which we would not consider to be an exceptional risk in daylight might be so in darkness. and an action which might not be an exceptional risk for a police officer or a firefighter might be so if you are an ordinary member of the public. because of their training and experience, police officers or firefighters should be in a better position to assess the risks. we believe that it would be unfair to apply the same tests to civilians . police officers injured in traffic accidents during car chases are not usually considered to be eligible for compensation unless there was another exceptionally risky factor, such as very bad weather conditions. 20accidental injury in general, you cannot receive compensation if you were injured accidentally. but there are some exceptions. if you were accidentally injured while trying to prevent or deal with an offence, or if you were an innocent bystander during an attempt to catch a suspected offender and were accidentally knocked over, you may be entitled toan award. this applies even if the suspected offence was not a violent crime (paragraph 8(c) of the scheme). 21poisoning if you have been injured as a direct result of a crime of poisoning, you may be entitled to an award (paragraph 8(a) of the scheme). 22injuries caused by animals you may be injured by an animal, for example, if a dog attacks you. but even though these attacks can be savage and very distressing, we can make an award only if the attack was a violent crime. 23we will consider making an award for an injury caused by a dog (orother animal) only if: athe person in charge of the dog deliberately set it on you; or bthe attack was a result of the dog owner failing to control an animal which was known to be vicious towards humans , and the lack of control can be shown to be reckless. if, for example, a dog with a previous history of vicious behaviour towards humans was allowed out without suitable restraint or in the charge of a child, this would probably be reckless behaviour. compensating victims of violent crime 2124injuries caused by vehicles (paragraph 11 of the scheme) the general rule is that we cannot pay compensation for injuries caused as a result of traffic accidents. the only exception is if the vehicle was used as a weapon. in general, we have to be satisfied that the driver of the vehicle deliberately drove it at you to injure you. if you are injured by a motor vehicle in normal circumstances on apublic road, you may receive compensation through the driver sinsurance company or, if the driver was not insured or identified, through the motor insurers bureau. their address is: linford wood house 6-12 capital drive linford wood milton keynes mk14 6xt. phone:01908 830001 25trespass on a railway if you are employed by a railway and see another person injured orkilled as a result of trespassing on the railway, you may be entitled to compensation for the mental injury you suffer. you may also be compensated if you discover a body on or next to the track, or are involved in the immediate aftermath of the incident. to receive an award, the mental injury must be serious enough to qualify for at least the lowest tariff level of award (paragraph 9(d) of the scheme). 22compensating victims of violent crime compensating victims of violent crime 23the applicants or victims behaviour, co-operation and criminal record (paragraphs 13 to 15 of the scheme) 1introduction compensation for an injury caused by a violent crime is an expression of public sympathy and support for innocent victims. the original scheme, introduced in 1964, said that people with significant criminal records, or whose own behaviour led to them being injured, or who failed to co-operate in bringing the offender to justice, would not receive compensation from public funds. these conditions have continued in each scheme since then. 2so, we have to consider whether one or more of the reasons set out in paragraphs 13 to 15 of the scheme apply to the application. if so, we may have to withhold or reduce an award, even if it is clear that you suffered a criminal injury as a result of a crime of violence. 3telling the police (paragraph 13(a) of the scheme) an offender does not have to have been convicted or even charged before we can make an award. some offenders are never found. ifyou are the victim of a crime, it is very important that you tell the police what happened as soon as you can, and co-operate with their enquiries and any prosecution. telling the police will generally involve more than just making a phone call. in most cases it will involve making a formal report about the incident that the police canuse. 4one reason why it is important for you to report the incident to the police is that it is our main protection against fraud. if you have not reported the incident to the police, and have no good reason for not doing so, you should assume that we will reject any application for compensation. if you fail to tell the police about the incident, we will not accept the excuse that you feared a revenge attack, did not recognise your attacker, or saw no point in reporting it. reporting these incidents can help the police prevent more offences against other people. 5you must report the incident personally unless your injuries prevent you from doing so. you must not assume that someone else has reported the incident, and even if they have, they may not have known the full facts. we will not accept reports by friends, relatives orworkmates unless there was a good reason for you not telling the police as well. part 4: why an award may be reduced or withheld (paragraphs 13 to 17 of the scheme) in most cases, telling the police will involve making a formal report about the incident that the police can use. we cannot award compensation if, without good reason, you failed to report the incident to the police. 24compensating victims of violent crime 6you must report all the relevant circumstances. if you deliberately leave out any important information or mislead the police in any way, we will reject an application for compensation. 7you should report the incident to the police as soon as possible . ifyou do not tell them immediately, it may be very difficult for the police to find your attacker. but we treat every case individually and we will take account of all good reasons for the delay in reporting the incident to the police for example, if it was clearly due to age (either young orold), or to some physical or mental injury, or to the psychological effects of the crime. we may also be sympathetic if you were unaware that your injury was due to a violent crime, or only discovered there was a connection long after the event. 8if you do not report the incident to the police immediately and only report it later to make a claim for compensation, we are likely to turn down your application. 9telling other organisations or people in authority we will not usually accept reports of crimes made to employers, trade-union officials or social workers rather than to the police. butwe may make exceptions in the case of injuries suffered, for example, in schools, residential homes, psychiatric hospitals and prisons, as long as you made an official report to someone in authority and were willing to have the matter formally investigated. 10in the case of a child, the person in authority will often be the childsparents, carers or guardians. if parents fail to tell the police, thechilds claim will still continue if it is unreasonable to expect the child to have taken the matter any further. but we must be able to investigate and gain evidence of the incident for which you are applyingfor compensation. if a parent or guardian does not report anincident involving a child to someone in authority, we are unlikely tohave enough information to make an award. 11there may be cases involving children where it is reasonable not to involve the police. minor incidents at school are examples of this. in these cases, it may be in the childs best interests for disciplinary action to be taken within the school, so we might accept a report to the school authorities. there are also behaviour issues which arise ifthe injury is caused by children playing dangerous games (see paragraph 18 of this part of the guide). 12helping the police to prosecute (paragraph 13(b) of the scheme) we may reduce or refuse compensation if, after reporting the incident to the police, you then fail to co-operate in bringing the offender to justice. there are two different situations which come under this heading. we will not normally award you compensation if you refuse toco-operate with the police, for example, by refusing to make a statement, go to an identity parade or go to court, or by making a statement which you later withdraw. if you do not report the incident to the police immediately, and only report it later to make a claim for compensation, we are likely to turn down your application. part 4 compensating victims of violent crime 25if you were clearly willing to co-operate but the police or the prosecuting authorities decided that no further action should betaken, we will make an award if you meet all the other requirements of the scheme. 13if you refused to co-operate with the police at first but then changed your mind and helped them in every way, we will consider whether itwould be right to make an award despite your initial refusal to co-operate. 14co-operating with us (paragraph 13(c) of the scheme) we are likely to refuse or reduce an award if you fail to help us orany other relevant authority in connection with your application. for example, we will probably refuse an award if you: fail, without a good excuse, to go to medical examinations orinspections that are needed to help us reach a decision in yourcase; persistently fail to respond to our requests for information; fail to tell us about important circumstances; or make false statements about the incidents or your injuries. if there is evidence that you have tried to defraud us, we will reportthe matter to the police and work closely with them to supportany prosecution. 15behaviour before, during or after the event (paragraphs 13(d) and14 of the scheme) under paragraphs 13(d) and 14 of the scheme, if your own behaviour caused or significantly contributed to the incident in which you were injured, we will normally refuse or reduce an award. 16these are some examples of situations where we may refuse or reduce an award: if your injury was caused in a fight in which you had voluntarily agreed to take part, even if the fight turns out to be much more serious than you expected. if you invited someone to come outside for a fist-fight, we will not usually award compensation, even if you ended up with the more serious injuries. the same islikely to apply if you chose to accept such a challenge by the offender. the fact that the offender went further and used a weapon will not normally make a difference. if, without good cause, you struck the first blow, regardless of howseriously you were hurt when that person fought back. if the incident in which you were injured formed part of a pattern ofviolence in which you took part voluntarily, for example, if there was a history of assaults involving both sides and you had previously attacked the other person. if you were injured while trying to get revenge against the personwho attacked you. if there is evidence that you have tried to defraud us, we will report the matter to the police and work closely with them to support any prosecution. if your own behaviour caused or significantly contributed to the incident in which you were injured, we will normally refuse or reduce an award. 26compensating victims of violent crime if you had drunk too much alcohol or used illegal drugs and thishad contributed to the attack which caused your injury (paragraph 14 of the 2001 scheme says that we must consider thisissue specifically). if you used offensive language or gestures, or behaved in an aggressive or threatening way, which led to the attack which caused your injuries. 17we may refuse an award even if the person who attacked you is convicted of a violent crime. his or her actions may have been entirely unreasonable and this may justify the conviction. but this does not necessarily mean that you were blameless, and if your ownbehaviour caused or contributed to the incident, we are likely torefuse or reduce an award. 18children playing dangerous games two problems arise from injuries due to dangerous games played bychildren. first, we must be satisfied that a violent crime has been committed. the fact that a game was dangerous will not be enough evidence on its own. second, even if a violent crime has been committed, we will not make an award if the child who caused the injury and the victim behaved in a similar way. if we did, we would justbe compensating the loser. for example, if 12-year-old boys fired stones from catapults at each other and one boy received aserious eye injury, this would technically be an assault, and so aviolent crime, but we would normally reject the application. in caseswhere the children are of different age groups or take unequal parts in the game, we may make a full or reduced awarddepending on how much each of the children took part andunderstood the risks involved. 19your criminal record (paragraph 13(e) of the scheme) we may refuse or reduce an award because of your character as shown by your criminal convictions. we will ignore any convictions which are spent (that is, convictions that you do not have to declare) under the rehabilitation of offenders act 1974, but we will take account of unspent convictions. 20this sort of rule has been part of every compensation scheme since the first, in 1964. the thinking behind it is that a person who has committed criminal offences has probably caused distress, loss or injury to other people, and has certainly caused expense to society because of police time, court appearances and the cost of supervising sentences. even though you may have been blameless in the incident, the scheme says that we must take account of your unspent convictions. the government is currently reviewing the rehabilitation of offenders act. when a revised system of dealing with convictions comes into force, we will adapt our own method of dealing with them.we may refuse an award even if the person who attacked you is convicted of a violent crime. we may refuse or reduce an award because of your character as shown by your criminal convictions. even though you may have been blameless in the incident, the scheme says that we must take account of your unspent convictions. part 4 compensating victims of violent crime 2721it is often not easy to be sure whether or not a conviction is spent under the rehabilitation of offenders act. the more serious the penalty the offender received, and the more recently it was given, the longer the conviction will take to become spent. a conviction leading to a prison sentence of 30 months or more can never become spent. there are more details in the home office leaflet wiping the slate clean , which you can get by phoning the freephone number listed atthe start of this guide. 22there are two principles which apply when we take account of unspent convictions. first, there are no absolute rules we must use our discretion. second, in general, the more recent the conviction and the more serious the penalty, the more we will take it into account. we treat the sentence as a guide to how serious the offence is. these principles are explained in more detail in the following paragraphs and table. 23the system is based on penalty points. the more recent the conviction and the more serious the penalty, the more penalty points the conviction will attract. and the more penalty points the conviction has, the greater percentage reduction we may make to any award. we will also take account of any convictions you receive after the incident or after applying, right through to the date when your case isfinally settled. the table on the next page shows how much unspent convictions may count against an award. in all cases, wetotally ignore spent convictions. the percentage reductions we will consider for the various levels ofpenalty points are as follows. penalty pointspercentage reduction 0 to 20% 3 to 525% 6 to 750% 8 to 975% 10 or more100% 24we and the criminal injuries compensation appeals panel are not bound by the penalty-points system, but we must take account of all unspent convictions. the penalty-points are our starting point for this, but we consider convictions and penalty points together with all the other circumstances of the application. for example, a points total which could reduce an award or lead us to refuse the claim will probably not lead to this if the injury resulted from helping the police to uphold the law, or helping someone who was being attacked. or there may be evidence of rehabilitation that the points system does not show and which we would take into account. on the other hand, a low points score is no guarantee that we will make an award if, for example, the record includes violent or sexual offences. 28compensating victims of violent crime sentence of period between the date of thepenalty the courtsentence and

date we receive your application as if they had been given on the day before we receive the application. part 4 compensating victims of violent crime 29notes(table opposite) 1we count penalty points as in this table for all applications we receive on or after 1 january 2003. for applications we receive before that date, we count penalty points in the way set out in the previous edition of this guide. 2imprisonment, whether suspended or not, means the sentence givenby the court, not the time spent in prison. 3imprisonment includes a sentence of detention in a young offenders institution or other custodial sentence. 4sentences spent under the rehabilitation of offenders act 1974 do not attract penalty points. 5we will put other sentences into one of the six categories depending on how serious the offence is, as measured by the rehabilitation period set under the rehabilitation of offenders act 1974. 6in the case of applications where someone has died, we will work out the points from the date of the sentence to the date the person died, not to the date we receive the application. 25applying these rules if the victim has died (paragraph 15 of the scheme) under paragraph 15 of the scheme, if you are applying for compensation following the victims death whether or not the death was caused by his or her criminal injuries we have to apply the rules in paragraphs 13 and 14 of the scheme to both you, as the person applying, and the victim. so, for example, if eitheryou or thevictim had a record of unspent criminal convictions, we have totake this into account. 26the only exception to these rules is an application for funeral expenses, where we have to apply the rules to the victim but nottothe person applying. so if you have a serious criminal record, we will pay you reasonable funeral expenses following the victims death if you meet the other conditions. however, if the victim had a criminal record, we have to take this into account. violence, including sexual offences, withinthe family (paragraphs 16 and 17 of the scheme) 27general it is a general condition of the scheme that any person who causes an injury must not benefit from an award paid to the victim (paragraph 16 of the scheme). so, we will probably not be able to make an award if there is a continuing close link between the victim and the offender which makes it likely that the offender would benefit from the award. if the victim has died, if either you or the victim had a record of unspent criminal convictions, we have to take this into account. any person who causes an injury must not benefit from an award to the victim. 30compensating victims of violent crime 28if the application is made by or on behalf of a child, we also need to be satisfied that it would not be against the childs interests to make an award (paragraph 16 of the scheme). an example might be if the child was very young at the time of an assault, and could reasonably be expected to make a full recovery and forget or not know that it had happened. that might be a better outcome than if we made an award, invested it on the childs behalf and released it to him or her at age 18, which might reopen the incident in the young persons mind and cause considerable distress. 29the rules in this area apply particularly where the victim and the offender were living in the same household as members of the same family (paragraph 17 of the scheme). we cannotmake an award in these circumstances for any injuries suffered before 1october 1979 (paragraph 7(b) of the scheme). (this is because the rule allowing us to make an award in same household cases was made only in 1979, so it cannot apply to incidents which happened before that.) but even if the injury was more recent, we have to be satisfied that the offender would not benefit from an award of compensation. 30adults if you and the person who injured you were living in the same household at the time of the incident (whether married or not), and you were an adult at the time, we will not award compensation unless: athe person who injured you has been prosecuted or there are good reasons why this has not happened; and byou and the person who injured you stopped living together before you applied for compensation and are unlikely to do so again. 31children if a child is the victim, condition (b) above does not apply but, as explained above, we must be satisfied that the offender would not benefit and that it would not be against the childs interests to make an award. please ask us for the separate leaflet child abuse andthe criminal injuries compensation scheme if this is relevant to you. time limits for applying (paragraph 18 of the scheme)1in general, we can consider your application only if we receive itwithin two years of the incident which caused your injury. the purpose of the time limit is to provide a reasonable period for peopleto make an application, and to make sure that our investigation ofnewer applications is not slowed down too much bychecking thefacts of older ones. it is usually more difficult to getreliable information about police investigations and medical treatment givenatthe time for incidents that happened a long time ago records are harder to get hold of and may actually have beendestroyed. 2under paragraph 18 of the scheme, we may accept applications outside this two-year period only if, because of the particular circumstances of the case, it is reasonable and in the interests ofjustice to do so. this test for accepting a late application is quite atough one. 3reasonable means, among other things, that it was not realistic to expect an application to be made within the two-year period. in the interests of justice means, among other things, that it is not going tobe too difficult to get reliable evidence of the circumstances of theincident and how serious the injury is. paragraph 18 says that both parts of the test must be met. if, for example, we cannot get independent information about how your injury happened, we have no basis on which to consider making an award. if this is the case, there is little point in us agreeing to consider a late application, as this would just prolong the process with no real benefit. so we are not likely to accept a late application in these circumstances, even ifthere was a good reason why you did not apply earlier. 4there are some circumstances in which we may accept a late application, as long as we can investigate and check the details ofthe incident. for example, we will consider a late application sympathetically if: for some reason, you were not able to act for yourself at the time; you were under 18 at the time of the incident (as long as you then apply soon after reaching the age of 18); or your injuries become noticeable only some time after the incident which caused them, as long as you apply as soon as you discover the cause. part 5: assessing your application (paragraphs18to29 of the scheme) in general, we can consider your application only if we receive it within two years of the incident which caused your injury. compensating victims of violent crime 31the standard of proof for applications, andprocedural issues (paragraphs 19 to 22 of the scheme) 5making the case, and legal representation (paragraph 19 of thescheme) paragraph 19 of the scheme says that the person applying must make the case that he or she is entitled to an award. in practice, wedo a great deal to help the process for example, we get reports from the police, doctors and hospitals. but if you have, or want to get, evidence which supports your case and which we are unlikely toget through our normal enquiries, it is up to you to send it to us assoon as you can. 6paragraph 19 also says that we will not meet the costs of any representation, such as legal costs. the scheme has been designed so that the outcome is always the same whether you are represented or not. it is up to you whether to get the help of a lawyer, but we cannot meet the cost of this. 7standard of proof (paragraph 20 of the scheme) in the criminal courts, the accused person will be convicted of a crime only if he or she is proved guilty beyond reasonable doubt. although we will make an award only when we are satisfied that youare entitled to one, we do not need to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt but on the balance of probabilities. this is an easier test to meet. we must be satisfied that it is more likely than notthat you are entitled to an award. this is the standard of proof which we have to apply to all the decisions we make. for example, we need to be satisfied that it is more likely than not that a violent crime is responsible for your injury, and more likely than not that youwere blameless in the incident. 8two important points arise from this. first, we may be able to makeanaward even if a person charged with the offence has been acquitted. it may not have been possible to be sure that the person charged was guilty, but it may still be more likely than not that a violent crime happened, and that you were a victim of it who is entitled to an award. second, if there is no evidence available on a crucial issue, or if there is conflicting evidence and no reliable way of telling where the truth lies, we cannot make an award. we can make an award only if the balance of evidence is in your favour. 9procedural issues (paragraphs 21 and 22 of the scheme) paragraph 21 of the scheme says that if we cannot make a decision without an independent medical examination of your injuries, we willarrange and pay for an examination, and pay your reasonable expenses. it is important that you co-operate with us for example, you must not miss an appointment without a good reason. 10paragraph 22 of the scheme simply says that we must produce and publish this guide to explain how we deal with applications and reach our decisions. the scheme has been designed so that the outcome is always the same whether you are represented or not. it is up to you whether to get the help of a lawyer, but we cannot meet the cost of this. 32compensating victims of violent crime we must be satisfied that it is more likely than not that you are entitled to an award. part 5 types and limits of compensation that we can pay (paragraphs 23 to 25 of the scheme) 11types of compensation (paragraph 23 of the scheme) if you are the victim of a criminal injury, there are three possible types of award that you may be entitled to. the main type simply recognises that you have suffered the injury. this is called the standard amount of compensation or tariff award. we explain belowhow we work it out. 12the other two types of compensation are relevant in only a minority of cases. we award these as well as the tariff award, which means that you can qualify for them only if you also qualify for a tariff award. 13the first type compensates for lost earnings. paragraph23(b) of the scheme says that if you have lost earnings or the ability to earn for longer than 28 weeks as a direct result of the injury, you may claim for this. if you qualify for an award for lost earnings, we will pay compensation from the 29th week that you cannot work. the detailed rules on this are set out in paragraphs 30 to 34 of the scheme. if you want to apply for lost earnings as well as for a tariff award, you must let us know and we will send you a specific application form and guide to take you through this. 14the second additional type of compensation is called special expenses (paragraph23(c) of the scheme). the types of expenses you may claim for, and the rules for working this out, are set out in paragraphs 35 and 36 of the scheme. they cover things such as: the cost of medical treatment which cannot reasonably be providedby the national health service; the cost of care provided by a residential establishment or at home; and the cost of adaptations that need to be made to your home as aresult of your injury. 15as with compensation for lost earnings, we can pay for special expenses only if you were not able to work (or, if unemployed, wouldnot have been able to work) for more than 28 weeks after theinjury. but, unlike compensation for lost earnings, if you qualify for compensation for special expenses, we will pay this from the dateof the injury, rather than starting at the 28-week point. if you want to apply for compensation for special expenses as well as foratariff award, you should let us know and we will send you a specialapplication form and guide for this too. 16paragraph 23(d) and (e) of the scheme introduces the situation where the victim of a violent crime has died, whether as a result of the injury or otherwise. it refers to paragraphs 37 to 44 of the scheme, which set out the rules about who can apply for compensation in this situation and how much compensation they can apply for. in all fatal cases, youmust fill in a special application form. let us know and we will send this to you, together with a specific guide to compensation in such cases. if you qualify for an award for lost earnings, we can pay compensation from the 29th week that you cannot work. let us know if you want to apply for compensation for lost earnings, care costs or other special expenses as well as for a tariff award, and we will send you a special application form. if the victim has died, you must fill in a special application form. let us know and we will send one to you. compensating victims of violent crime 3317maximum award (paragraph 24 of the scheme) under paragraph 24 of the scheme, the maximum award arising from any injury is 500,000. there are two points to note about this limit. first, it applies to the injury rather than to the person applying . thismeans, for example, that if several people are applying for compensation following the death of a victim of crime, the maximumthat they can receive in total is 500,000. 18the second point is that 500,000 is the maximum award we can make before any deductions are made. an example may make this clearer. in a particularly serious case, a victim may suffer injuries for which the tariff award, plus care costs, plus lost earnings would if there were no limit be 800,000. in practice, the person applying could not receive more than the 500,000 maximum. but if the behaviour of the person applying had contributed to the incident in which he or she was injured, and we decided that it was right to reduce the award by 50%, that reduction would be applied to the 500,000 rather than to the 800,000 meaning that the person applying would receive 250,000. 19minimum award (paragraph 25 of the scheme) under paragraph 25 of the scheme, the minimum award is 1,000. if your injury is not serious enough to qualify for a 1,000 payment, we will not be able to make an award. again, there are two points arising from this rule. first, as with the maximum award, the minimum award relates to the injury rather than to the person applying. this means, for example, that if your injury was serious enough to justify a 1,000 award, but your behaviour in relation to the incident makes a 50% reduction in award level appropriate, you can still receive an award, but it would be reduced to 500. 20the second point is about the situation where a criminal injury makes a medical condition you were already suffering worse. the basic point here is that we can make an award only if the injury directly caused by the violent crime is serious enough to justify a payment of at least 1,000. for instance, following a crime of violence, you may suffer astrained back lasting up to 13 weeks. if you had no previous back problems, you would be eligible for an award of 1,000. but if you were already suffering from a strained back and the violent crime made it 50% worse, you would not have a criminal injury which, on itsown, justified an award of at least 1,000. in these circumstances, unfortunately, we would not be able to make an award at all. we can make an award only if the injury directly caused by the violent crime is serious enough to justify a payment of at least 1,000. 34compensating victims of violent crime part 5 the tariff of injuries and awards (paragraphs26 to 29 of the scheme) 21introduction to the tariff (paragraph 26 of the scheme) the tariff, which is printed at the back of the scheme, sets out what awards we can pay (before any deductions are made) if you have suffered a criminal injury. the tariff is in two parts. the first is a list of25levels of compensation, ranging from level 1 (1,000) to level 25 (250,000). (as noted above, compensation for lost earnings and special expenses can raise the total payment to a maximum of 500,000.) 22the second part is a list of more than 400 injury descriptions, together with a level of compensation and amount of money we canpay for each. in most respects this is self-explanatory you canfind the description of the injury which you have suffered and check the amount of compensation which you can expect to receive (depending on rules regarding eligibility, reductions and so on). there is an index to the tariff on pages 22 to 24 of the scheme. referring to this is the simplest way of finding any particular injury description. 23it is worth noting that the tariff begins with those injuries which do notrelate to a specific single part of the body, such as fatal injuries, multiple burns, mental illness, nerve damage and physical and sexual assault and abuse. it then uses a head to toe approach, dealing first with injuries to the head and neck, followed by injuries tothe arms, torso and legs. 24many of the terms used in the tariff are rather technical. in appendix 1 to this guide, these terms are explained in more everyday language. 25as we explained in paragraph 20 above, if the injury speeds up or makes worse a medical condition that you were already suffering, theaward we can make will be based only on the extent to which themedical condition was speeded up or made worse. 26multiple injuries (paragraph 27 of the scheme) we deal with multiple injuries in two different ways in the tariff, depending on how serious they are. first, minor multiple injuries is atariff description for which we will pay compensation of 1,000. we are not suggesting that these injuries will seem minor to the person who suffered them. the scheme uses the term to show the minimum level of injuries for which we may pay compensation. 27note 12 to the tariff, on page 28 of the scheme, describes what comes under this heading. briefly, it covers cases where you have not received any single injury which is serious enough for the 1,000 minimum award, but where you suffered several less serious injuries such as cuts, severe bruising, a black eye or hair pulled from the scalp. paragraph 27 of the scheme and note 12 mean that you may receive compensation if you suffered at least three injuries of this type, if at least one of them was still troubling you significantly six weeks after the incident, and if the injuries meant that you had to visit your doctor at least twice in that six-week period. you may receive compensation if you suffered at least three minor injuries, if at least one of them was still troubling you significantly six weeks after the incident, and if the injuries meant that you had to visit your doctor at least twice in that six-week period. compensating victims of violent crime 3528the other situation in which multiple injuries are relevant is when they are more serious when you suffered two or more injuries so serious that each on its own would qualify for compensation. 29there are two important points to note in this situation. first, we can provide compensation only for the three most serious injuries which you have suffered the scheme does not allow us to consider any injuries beyond that. second, we do not simply add up the tariff awards we will pay for the three most serious injuries. instead, we pay the total tariff award for the most serious injury, plus 30% of the tariff award for the second most serious injury, plus 15% of the tariff award for the third most serious injury. 30injuries not listed in the tariff (paragraphs 28 and 29 of thescheme) the tariff cannot describe every possible injury. it would obviously bewrong to deny compensation to people who had suffered serious criminal injuries which, for whatever reason, are not included in the tariff. paragraphs 28 and 29 deal with this situation. 31if we receive an application in such a case, we will consult the appeals panel about what might be the right level of compensation for the injury and then recommend to the home secretary that theinjury and level of compensation are added to the tariff. in the meantime, we are allowed to make a provisional payment of up to50% of the value of the compensation payment which we recommend to the home secretary. we can provide compensation only for the three most serious injuries which you have suffered. we pay the total tariff award for the most serious injury, plus 30% of the tariff award for the second most serious injury, plus 15% of the tariff award for the third most serious injury.

howwe dealwith your applicationacknowledgement and enquiries4.1we will acknowledge your application and give you a personal reference number which will help usto identify it quickly should you need to contact us.4.2we will then normally make enquiries of the police, medical authorities and other relevant bodies toenable your claim to be assessed.4.3it is important that you give all reasonable help to us in connection with your application(paragraph 13(c)).assessment of yourapplication4.4claims officers in the authority are responsible for deciding in accordance with the scheme whatawards (if any) should be made in individual cases, and how they should be paid.4.5as soon as we have the information we need, we will first decide whether your application isacceptable within the rules in paragraphs 6 to 12, and 38(fatal cases) of the scheme. these areexplained in some detail in parts 7-9of this guide but, amongst other factors, we will need toconsider whether an award should be withheld or reduced under any of the provisions ofparagraphs 13 to 16.personal injury4.6if your application is acceptable we will assess whether or not your injury is serious enough toqualify for at least the minimum award payable under the tariff(paragraph 25, note 1 on thetariff of awards; see also part 7.6of this guide).4.7we will then identify the tariff level into which your injury falls (paragraphs 25 to 29 and tariffof awards). to help us do that, we may ask you to attend a centre as near as possible 5to your home to have the injury examined by a doctor nominated by us (paragraph 20). we willpay reasonable travelling expenses for this purpose (covering, where appropriate, both your and acarers expenses).4.8where you suffer more than one qualifying injury, the tariff award will be that for the highest ratedinjury plus, where the other injuries are separate from the highest rated injury and from one another,10% of the tariff value of the second most serious injury and, where appropriate, 5% of the tariffvalue of the third most serious injury.this means, for example, that where the injuries are adepressed fracture of the skull (single tariff payment 6000), loss of 2 front teeth (2000) and abroken nose (1500), the combined award would be 6000 + 200 + 75 totalling 6275.4.9the tariff includes an element of compensation for the degree of shock which an applicant innormal circumstances would experience as a result of an incident resulting in injury. if the shock (asdefined in note 2 in the tariff of awards) is such that it would attract an award from a higher tarifflevel than the injury itself, then the award for shock will be paid rather than the award for injury.4.10an award will be reduced by the full amount of any payment of compensation or damages received in respect of the same injuries (paragraph 48).4.11if we make an award and you subsequently receive compensation or damages as described inparagraph 48of the scheme you will be required to pay to us the full amount of the other paymentup to the level of our award of compensation.compensation for loss of earnings (paragraphs 30-34)4.12if your injury has caused you to lose or is likely to cause you to lose earnings or earning capacity forlonger than 28 full weeks you may be eligible for additional compensation for this loss. if so, wewill ask you for details of your loss and send you a separate guide on how it is calculated.4.13please note that compensation is notpayable forthe first 28 full weeks of lost earnings orearning capacity.compensation for special expenses (paragraphs 35-36)4.14you may be considered for an additional amount of compensation if, as a direct result of the injuryyou have been incapacitated or are likely to be incapacitated for longer than 28 full weeks and haveincurred special expenses for medical/dental/optical treatment, related equipment and care. you donot have to be employed to be considered for compensation for special expenses which, providedyou meet the time condition, are payable from the date of the injury.we will ask you for details,sending you a separate guide.4.15if, after completing the personal injury application form, your circumstances change and you thinkyou may be eligible within the terms of the scheme to apply for additional compensation for loss ofearnings and/or special expenses you should write to this address quoting your reference number andgiving details of the change in your circumstances.fatal cases (paragraphs 37-44)4.16those eligible to applyare dependants or relatives (as shown in the next paragraph) of someonewho died as a result of a criminal injury, or who was criminally injured but died from some othercause.64.17 adependant or relative is someone who at the time of the deceaseds death was the deceaseds:-(a) husband or wife(b) unmarried but long term partner (of the opposite sex)(c)parent(d) *childor(e)former husband or wife who was financially supported by the deceased.* childmeans a person of any age -

clearly stating your fee account number but you will need to contact the support team to ensure the payment is allocated to your account without delay. government departments and local authorities

accepted) from which a direct debit payment can be made complete a fee account application form ensure sufficient funds are available in your bank account when payment is due to be debited provide a valid organisation email and postal delivery address as described in the application form - all correspondence will be to the billing address and not the email address provided on the application form ensure that each fee-attracting application lodged with the court, is accompanied by the correctly completed paperwork and/or a letter on business letterhead advising the fee to be paid to the court clearly and accurately quote your fee account number on any document sent to the court which requires a fee transaction in the form set out below participating courts will not process your application without your fee account reference (applications without a fee account number, that do not have any other form of valid payment attached, will be returned unprocessed. hm courts & tribunals service cannot be held responsible for any delays in processing documents where this occurs.) charging of court fees court fees are determined by the relevant policy and published in the appropriate statutory instruments. court fees are subject to renewal, generally annually, and may be increased or decreased. new fees may also be created and existing fees may be removed. statutory instrument updates are published to customers and the general public well in advance of the fees inception date. it is your responsibility to ensure that the correct court fee is quoted on any application or correspondence provided to the court for processing of a fee payment. fee attracting court documents and/or correspondenc e submitted for processing require you to state the amount of the court fee to be paid. where the incorrect fee, or no fee, is stated the documents will be processed by the court and the correct fee taken. where the court applies the correct fee and is required to alter the fee to a higher or lower value, you will be advised of the amount charged (when the documents are returned) so you can update your records for reconciliation purposes charging of remissions fees remission fee rates (if applied for) will be determined in the normal way by: complete and accurate application validity of the application and supporting evidence; the level of remission applied for and the fee type if the court is not satisfied with the remission application and/or does not agree with the partial remission applied for, the court will return the documentation to you with a covering letter of explanation. fee account t&c (01.16) page 6 of 7 if the court is satisfied with the remission application, the court documents will be processed and any partial contribution payable will be taken from your account. it is your responsibility to satisfy the documentat ion requirements of hm courts & tribunals service remissions scheme. withdrawal of claims courts process claims upon receipt, therefore refunds of fees will not be available after the date that the application is received by the court, even if the application is subsequently withdrawn. therefore, please check your claim carefully before submitting it to ensure that you wish to proceed with the action. refunds are only made in the circumstances detailed below. fee refunds fees may be refunded for the following reasons: a full or part fee is paid and the applicant is subsequently granted a remission for all or part of the fee - the application for fee remission must be made no more than six months after the original fee has been submitted after payment has been taken at the court, the application/paperwork is found to be invalid - the full amount of the fee is then refunded or a case is settled prior to judgment and the applicant is eligible for a full or partial-refund on the original hearing payment as per statutory rules the refund will be automatically applied directly to your fee account by the court and will be included in the next fee account invoice and direct debit settlement. working with the courts on all fee-attracting documents submitted to the court, the fee account number must appear in bold immediately below your organisations contact details in the address block on the court forms. the fee account number, and confirmation of its use, must be sent with any court documents. the confirmation letter must be provided using organisations letterhead paper and be signed by an authorised representative of the organisation. if no court documents are provided (for example, sending confirmation to take hearing fees) the fee account number must be quoted, in bold, in any correspondence. all correspondence must (a) be provided on the organisations letterhead paper and be signed by an authorised representative; or (b) originate as an email from an authorised representative of the organisation. updating your details you are required to notify hm courts & tribunal s service in advance of any changes to your business or billing contact details, including your email address/es, postal address/es, authorised representative, and/or bank account details. where necessary you may be required to complete a new direct debit mandate. to complete a new direct debit mandate, contact the fee account support team. fee account t&c (01.16) page 7 of 7 queries any

the same room. the mediator will explain the nature of the process and then normally invite each party or their representative to speak briefly as to their pos ition. the mediator may ask them questions in each other's presence. it will then be for the mediator to decide wh at further meetings ar e warranted and whether they should be with the parties separately or together. it is usual for there to be some separate meetings. at these, the mediator will probably be lo oking not only at each party's rights and obligations but also at their need s and expectations, seeking to encourage the parties to propose and embrace solutions to their differences. a time limit of 5 hours has been placed on scheme mediations, w ith the fee including preparation time by the mediator. it is normally clear before then whether sufficient progress is being made to justify con tinuing with the pro cess. any extension of time is a matter before the mediator and the parties. no furthe r fee is payable without specific agreement to that effect. agreement in whole or in part at the mediation upon reaching an agreement, the terms of se ttlement will be recorded in writing at the conclusion of the mediation and signed by th e parties. they should then be lodged by the mediator either direct or th rough cedr solve with the civil appeals office, and the parties should also lodge a consent order. it may be possible to resolve some but not all th e issues in dispute. in that case, any partial agreement should be recorded in writing and signed by the parties, and can be lodged with the court so that proceedings can be treated as resolved to that extent. no agreement at the mediation if no agreement is reached, ce dr solve will inform the civil appeals office so that the appeal process can continue. civil appeals office royal courts of justice 11 january 2011 6 feedback about mediation cedr solve will normally cont act the parties to a mediatio n shortly after it has taken place to obtain feedback as to how it went and the impression given by the mediator. this feedback will be shared with both the mediator co ncerned and the court in an endeavour to maintain the highest standards. your participation in this process will be welcomed. if you have general queries regarding me diation please contact cedr solve at 70 fleet street london ec4y 1eu telephone 020 7536 6060

the overall effect on the case management timetable, e.g. whether the loss of the trial date is more signicant than the procedural point you wish to appeal; the impact on the welfare of the child(ren) and the timetable for the child(ren); and whether it would be more convenient to deal with your point at the trial. you must request permission to appeal in this notice if you did not ask for permission to appeal at the hearing at which the decision you are appealing against was made; or you asked for permission, but it was refused, and you wish the appeal court to reconsider your request. you do not need permission if the order you are appealing against is one of the following: a committal order a secure accommodation order under section 25 of the children act 1989 or section 119 social services and well-being (wales) act 2014 to ask the appeal court to uphold the decision of the lower court, even though it is for different or additional reasons if you need more time than that allowed for ling your respondents notice, you must make an application in the notice itself. (see the notes to section 8). section 5grounds for appealing, or for upholding the order if you are appealing against the lower courts order, your appeal (appealing includes asking for the order to varied) must be based on relevant grounds (reasons). an appeal court will only allow an appeal against a decision that was either: wrong; or unjust because of a serious procedural or other irregularity in the lower court proceedings. the appeal court will be unlikely to overturn a decision where no real difference would be made to the outcome of the case; or the appeal would involve re-examining the factual investigation undertaken by the lower court. asking the court to uphold a decision is not an appeal but you must give reasons if asking for it to be upheld on different or additional grounds. set out briey your reasons why you think the judges decision was wrong or unjust (referred to as your grounds of appeal). if possible, list your reasons in short separately numbered paragraphs. remember that you must not include any grounds which rely on new evidence, that is, evidence that has become available since the order was made. you may not produce new evidence without rst obtaining the permission of the high court. (see the notes to section 8). section 6arguments in support of grounds of appeal please indicate by ticking the relevant box that you have also attached a document setting out your arguments in support of your grounds of appeal (referred to as your skeleton argument) to this notice or that it will be led later in the proceedings if you do not have a legal representative, you do not have to do a separate skeleton argument but may do so if you wish. any separate skeleton argument has to be led and served on the appellant and all other respondents with your completed respondents notice no later than 14 days after you receive the appellants skeleton argument. your skeleton argument should contain a numbered list of points that you intend to argue at the appeal hearing. each point should be stated in no more than a few sentences. refer at each point to any documents you are ling with your respondents notice which supports that argument. (see section 9 on documents) if you have not attached your arguments to your notice, do not delay in sending your notice. (see section 9) section 7what decision are you asking the court to make set out details of the order(s) (or the variation to the original order(s)) that you want the appeal court to make. section 8other applicationsif you want to apply for an extension of time for ling your respondents notice, you must make this application in part a of this section. you should state the reason for the delay and the steps taken up to the time of ling the notice. you may wish to make additional applications to the appeal court in connection with your appeal or application to vary or uphold the order. any other applications may be made either in the notice, or in a separate application notice (form fp244). this form can be obtained from the court or online from hmctscourtnder.justice.gov.uk you may have to pay additional fees if it is led at a later date than your respondents notice. the types of application you might want to make will include: amending (make changes to) your respondents notice after it has been led at court. but note that you can amend your skeleton argument (even if it is set out in part 7 of your notice) without making an application; asking the appeal court to issue a stay on executing the order or suspend any action in the case pending the outcome of the appeal. (you do not need to do this if you have already obtained a stay from the lower court.); producing new evidence in the appeal or asking for permission to produce oral evidence at the appeal hearing. you will need to give reasons why the new evidence was not before the original court and, where oral evidence is requested, the reasons why you think it is necessary; asking for security for costs, ie that the appellant be ordered to pay a sum of money into court sufcient to cover any costs the appellant may be ordered to pay in the appeal. you, or your solicitor if you are legally represented, should sign the statement of truth at the bottom of this section to support any evidence you provide. it is important you check the information contained in the notice is correct before signing. it is a contempt of court to sign a false statement of truth without an honest belief in its truth, for which you can be ned, have your assets seized or be sentenced to a term of imprisonment. the notice must be signed by you or your solicitor if legally represented. unsigned forms will be returned by the court which could lead to the appeal being dismissed as it is out of time. section 9supporting documentsyou may have additional documents to those led by the appellant to support your appeal or your request to vary or uphold the order. these should be in a bundle and led with your respondents notice. do not delay ling your respondents notice at the appeal court. if you have not been able to obtain any of the documents that you wish to le with your notice, complete the notice as best you can and ensure that it is led on time. your bundle should include any of the following (unless they are already included in the bundle led by the appellant):- your respondents notice and any skeleton argument (if separate); any witness statements in support of any application included in sections 5 or 9 of your notice or in a separate application notice; any other witness statement led in support of your arguments; and any other documents directed by the court to be led in the appeal. do not le any other documents other than those directed by the court without rst obtaining permission from the court to do so. additional documents will not be read by the judge. you should remember that if you le any of the documents at a later date, you must check whether or not the information you are providing alters any of the details already given in your respondents notice. if it does, you will need to apply to the court for permission to amend the notice. the court can tell you how to do this. what happens next?",erm of imprisonment. the notice must be signed by you or your solicitor if legally rep

terms of an order for payment 20to suspend the execution of a possession warrant 214introductionthe following notes provide you with information about the handling of possession cases in the high court or a county court. they are intended to be of general use in handling straightforward claims for possession and of particular use in urgent cases involving anti-social behaviour or trespassers. the notes do not claim to be fully comprehensive: they are no substitute for the relevant rules and practice directions themselves. they do, however, highlight the procedures you should use, or might consider using, to get the best out of your local court. using the guidancethe guidance begins with a quick reference list of steps you might want to consider taking during the course of a claim where obtaining possession quickly is particularly important or where your tenants, officials, witnesses, or others are being put at risk. the guidance notes following the quick reference list give detailed information about the procedures, the possession process as a whole, including relevant forms, information leaflets and time limits, and explains the role that court staff play in processing your claims. liaison with courts knowledge of court procedures and powers and the way court staff handle possession proceedings are obviously useful. but establishing regular contact with your local court is even more important. your initial contact should be with the court manager who may refer you to, for example, the person in charge of the issue section, or the listing officer. the court will welcome knowing in advance how many claims you will be issuing and when, since this will allow them to make arrangements to deal with the work on its arrival. it will also help you. staff will normally be able to tell you the hearing date you will be given if your claims are issued on a certain date. this in turn will allow you to calculate arrears up to the issue date, and enable you to insert the hearing date and time on the face of the claim form, again saving the court time and enabling your claims to proceed to service more quickly. it may also be possible to agree specific administrative arrangements for the handling of your cases, for example, a guaranteed turnaround on issue which is less than the normal target of 5 working days, in return for your preparing some additional documentation such as the defence form. this is something you can discuss with the court manager. court user groups the court will also be able to give you details of its court user group. normally the group meets once or twice a year and you may find it helpful to join. user groups provide a forum for discussing new legislation, enable you to raise issues such as court practices and facilities, and allow you to seek clarification from a judge about practice and procedure. hearing dates the availability of early hearing dates is a matter of frequent concern. the court knowing your regular requirements will help. you must bear in mind, however, that listing is a judicial function. it is the judge who ultimately decides which cases should be given priority, not the court manager, nor the listing officer. nonetheless, court staff will always make whatever efforts they can to ensure your urgent work is treated as such. advance warning of any urgent work, by telephone, 5will help the court meet your needs. for example, let the court know of your intention to file an application for an injunction as soon as you know you will be making one. tell the court at what time you expect to issue the application. do not wait until all the paperwork is ready for issue and then take it to the court, expecting court staff to be able to find a judge immediately. prior notice will allow court staff time to find another judge if one is not available at their court, or to arrange for a deputy to release a suitable judge at your local court who can deal with your application. in the latter case this will be to your benefit since you will be saved the expense of a journey to another court. courts do provide an out-of-hours scheme for dealing with urgent injunctions and related matters. your local court manager will be able to supply you with details. with regard to listing more generally you should bear in mind that court managers do not have sole control over the judicial resources allocated to them. if they require more than they are allocated, they will have to make a case to their group manager. this will be balanced against requests from other courts. where a request for additional allocation is made, it is important that court mangers can back their request with detailed information about future workload and whether it will be a sustained, or temporary, need. it is, therefore, in your interest to provide the court manager with as much information about the number of cases you intend to issue on a regular basis and, especially, for example, if you are intending any particular initiative to clear arrears that may mean you will be issuing more claims at any one time than you normally would. anti-social behaviour and health and safety issues an area where liaison with the court is especially crucial is where you are issuing proceedings containing allegations of anti-social behaviour or where there has otherwise been actual or threatened assault by one or more defendant. you should be aware that court staff, and particularly bailiffs, do not have any powers of restraint where a party becomes, or threatens, violence. if court staff fear a breach of the peace, are threatened with, or encounter, actual violence, they will normally have to enlist the help of the police, like any other ordinary citizen. police may be available where the court is also a combined court centre, but many courts are not. in these courts particularly, staff will need to make contingency arrangements if violence is expected. any information you can provide about the potentially violent person, will be vital in enabling staff to get the help they need to protect your representatives, themselves, the judge and other people at the court. for example, you should indicate on the claim form where the particulars contain an allegation of assault or threatened assault. a reasonable time before any hearing, you should let the court have as much information about the violent, or potentially violent, person as possible, for example: whether they are fering from any form of mental illness; wn to the police, or have a criminal record of violence; fer violence to any particular party who might be attending the hearing, such as a witness;wn to have any firearms or other offensive weapons; or ttend the hearing with or without some of their supporters. similar information should always be provided where injunctions are granted which lead to the issue of a warrant of arrest or committal, or where the claim leads to an eviction. 6quick reference list pre-issue you can apply to the court for an injunction to protect people or property before issuing proceedings for possession. you can also apply for interim injunctions while a possession claim is proceeding. either can be dealt with without notice, that is, without telling the party, or parties, against whom the injunction is being sought. applications must be supported by evidence, and where made without notice, an explanation of why this is necessary. issue and service you may be able to reduce the overall period between issue and the hearing by: e the claim form personally yourself rather than waiting for the court to serve the claim by post; y applying for the period between service and hearing to be abridged (shortened); and t the same time, applying for an earlier (an expedited) hearing. hearingsnever simply arrive at the court to issue anything urgent. you should maintain regular contact with the court manager or listing officer about your needs, urgent or not. give advance warning by telephone as soon as you know you will be issuing proceedings with brief details about the nature of them and the reason for urgency. witnesses witness evidence at a possession hearing may be given in writing without the witness attending. however, if the maker of the witness statement does not attend the hearing and the other party disputes material evidence, the court will normally adjourn the hearing so that oral evidence can be given. where the claim is allocated to the fast or multi-track, or the court has ordered it, witnesses must attend. if your witnesses are to attend court, consider whether they need protection. if you give the court notice, staff can arrange for them to wait separately from other parties to the claim before the hearing starts and can also arrange for them to leave the court separately. remember that witness harassment or intimidation is now a criminal offence in civil proceedings under the criminal justice and police act 2001. reassure your witnesses by letting them know what they can expect to happen at court. an information leaflet about being a witness is available from the county court. consider whether to use professional witnesses, such as public environmental health officers, rather than other tenants who may be subject to harassment. evidenceconsider the use of tape recordings as part of your evidence, for example of telephone conversations or noise nuisance; video recordings from surveillance cameras; or photographs. 7enforcement in cases of extreme urgency, you may be able to contact the bailiffs to discuss an eviction date before issuing a warrant of possession. if there are violent occupants at the property, you must warn the bailiffs as soon as possible. they will then be able to take early steps to arrange additional bailiff or police help. 8notes for guidance 1. issue of a claim for possession (against tenants or trespassers) a claim for possession is a claim for the recovery of possession of land, including buildings or parts of buildings. rules and procedures relating to possession claims are contained in part 55 of the civil procedure rules (cpr) and its accompanying practice direction). the procedure set out in section 1 of part 55 applies to claims for possession brought: y landlords or former landlords; y mortgagees; or y licensors or former licensors; or ainst trespassers; and here a tenant is seeking relief from forfeiture. they are fixed date claims; that is, the court will fix a date for hearing when it issues the claim (rule 55.5(1)). contact the court before issuing your claims and particularly if you are seeking an injunction, have an urgent claim against trespasses or a possession claim involving anti-social tenants where you will be seeking to abridge service and expedite the hearing (see procedure below). make sure you pass on any information you have if there is any possibility of violence, or threat of violence. if this is information you cannot include in your particulars of claim, please include it in a covering letter, suitably highlighted. prior contact will benefit both you and the court, particularly in cases involving anti-social tenants. tell the court how many claims you propose to issue and when. court staff will normally be able to tell you the date on which your claims will be heard. in cases involving rent arrears, this allows you to calculate the arrears up to the date of issue. it also forewarns the court of expected workload and allows them to make contingency arrangements, if necessary, to ensure that your claims are issued without delay. requirements for claims for possession based on grounds of arrears of rent and other breaches of tenancy agreements and claims against trespassers you will require: form n5 possession claim form where you are issuing a claim against trespassers and some, or all, of the defendants names are not known, you must issue the claim against persons unknown either with or without the names that are known, as is appropriate. (rule 55.3(4)) 9form n119 particulars of claim (if one of the grounds for possession is arrears of rent and you are claiming possession of residential premises). ( form n119a notes for guidance to help claimants complete form n119 are available from the court.) where the grounds do not include arrears of rent, or you are not claiming possession of residential premises, you must produce your own particulars of claim, providing all the detail required by the practice direction to cpr part 55; or form n121 particulars of claim if the claim is against trespassers. (but see also note below concerning service of any additional evidence.) provide sufficient copies of the claim form and particulars of claim to allow one copy for yourself, one for the court, one for each defendant, and where applicable, one for any representatives of any other interested parties (e.g. underlessees). additional copies may be required where the claim is against trespassers whose names are unknown (see below). the court fee a leaflet county court fees is available as a quick reference. ask the court for a copy. copies are updated to meet any changes in the fees orders. a request that the papers be returned to you for personal service, if you wish to serve the claim on the defendant yourself. if your claim is against trespassers, you must file any supporting evidence, for example, witness statements, with sufficient copies for service, when you file your claim form bailiff service of claims is not available in the high court and only in one particular circumstance in the county courts. where your claim is against trespassers and the defendants names are not known, that is, the claim is issued against persons unknown, you may make a written request that the county court bailiff serve the defendants. no fee is payable. the bailiff may serve the documents by: ttaching copies of the claim form, particulars of claim and any supporting evidence to the main door or some other part of the land so that they are clearly visible; and practical, by inserting copies of those document in a sealed, transparent envelope addressed to the occupiers through the letter box; or y placing stakes in the land in places where they are clearly visible and attaching to each stake copies of the claim form, particulars of claim and any witness statements in a sealed transparent envelope addressed to the occupiers. where such a request is, made you must provide the necessary plastic envelopes and stakes. (rule 55.6) 10checks before submitting your claim to the court you should check that: orm and particulars of claim are in the right form, are fully and correctly completed, and the statement of truth on both is signed. make sure you have indicated the type of claim by ticking the appropriate box on the reverse of the claim form; the claim is against trespassers, that you have filed any witness statements that support your claim; ou are issuing in the right court; that is, the county court for the district in which the property is situated (rule 55.3(1)); ou are submitting the correct fee (fees change from time to time; you should check that you have the current fees order or leaflet); rect solicitors costs, if any, are being claimed (schedule 2 of civil procedure rules, county court rules order 38, rule 18, appendix b). you may, exceptionally, issue the proceedings in the high court. exceptional circumstances would be if there are complicated disputes of fact, or there are points of law of general importance, or the claim is against trespassers and there is a substantial risk of public disturbance or of serious harm to persons, or property, which properly require immediate determination. the value of the property and the amount of any financial claim may be relevant circumstances but these factors alone will not normally justify starting a claim in the high court. a claim started in the high court must be accompanied by a certificate setting out the reasons for doing so. the certificate must contain a statement of truth. if the court decides that a claim has been started in the high court inappropriately, the court will either strike out the claim, or order its transfer to a county court and disallow the costs of issue and transfer. if you are issuing in the high court, that you have included a certificate giving your reasons for doing so supported by a statement of truth - there is no standard form for this. (see also under additional information below for interim applications at the time of issue) court procedures the court will: epare form n206b notice of issue, which tells you the claim number and hearing date, or endorse this information on any schedule of claims you provide; se the claim number and hearing date on all copies of the claim form and particulars of claim and seal them (if you have not already done so); epare a claim form and particulars of claim for service on the defendant, adding to them a defence form ( form n11r where the claim is for possession of residential premises or form n11 in any other case) a list of local advice agencies, and notes for guidance fordefendant (form n7) where the premises are rented residential;e the documents by post, or hand you back the copies if you are serving yourself. exceptionally, as described above, pass the papers to the bailiff for service with the stakes and envelopes you have provided. 11additional information service the court will serve the claim form, particulars of claim, defence form and notes for guidance (where appropriate) by first class post, except where you say that you wish to serve the documents yourself. date of service where postal service is used, the date of service is deemed to be the second day after it was posted unless that day falls on a saturday, sunday, bank holiday, christmas day, or good friday. in these cases the deemed date of service is the next working day. personal service is effected on the day of handing to the defendant. (cpr part 6) personal service and proof of service where a claim for possession against a tenant is served personally, it is a matter for you when this is done, but the claim form and particulars of claim must be served not less than 21 days before the date fixed for the hearing (rule 55.5(3)). a certificate of service (in form n215 certificate of service) must be produced at the hearing (rule 55.8(6)) if the defendant does not file a defence, or appear at the hearing. the periods for service of claims against trespassers are set out in the paragraph below. target dates for hearings for non-trespass cases, the date of hearing will normally take place not less than 28 days and no more than 8 weeks from the date of issue of the claim. (rule 55.5 (3)) for claims against trespassers the court will give a hearing date as soon as possible allowing the defendants no less than 5 clear days notice, from service, where the claim involves residential premises, and no less than 2 clear days notice where it does not. (rule 55.5 (2)) abridging time for service and expediting hearing date the courts case management powers under the cpr part 3 provide for varying the time for compliance with any rule. you may wish to consider making an application of this kind, particularly in possession cases involving anti-social tenants where: son for whom the defendant is responsible, has assaulted, or threatened to assault; the claimants staff; or another resident in the locality; e are reasonable grounds for fearing such assault; or son for whom the defendant is responsible, has caused serious damage or threatened to cause serious damage to the property or to the home or property of another resident in the locality. 12if these matters are alleged in the particulars of claim, the court will give particular consideration to exercising its powers under rule 3.2 (1) (a) and (b). you must, however, submit the appropriate application notice when you issue the claim and support your application with evidence to justify your request. it would help the court, and save delay in issuing your claim, if, with your application notice, you produce a draft of the order you are asking the court to make. the application may be made without giving notice to the defendant. if the order is granted a copy of the order must be served on the defendant with the claim form and other documents.

questionnaire if the claim is not settled, a judge must allocate it to an appropriate case management track. to help the judge choose the most just and cost-effective track, you must now complete the attached questionnaire.if you fail to return the allocation questionnaire by the date given, the judge may make an order which leads to your claim or defence being struck out, or hold an allocation hearing. if there is an allocation hearing the judge may order any party who has not filed their questionnaire to pay, immediately, the costs of that hearing. use a separate sheet if you need more space for your answers marking clearly which section the information refers to. you should write the claim number on it, and on any other documents you send with your allocation questionnaire. please ensure they are firmly attached to it. the letters below refer to the sections of the questionnaire and tell you what information is needed.a settlementunder the civil procedure rules parties should make every effort to settle their case before the hearing. this could be by discussion or negotiation (such as a roundtable meeting or settlement conference) or by a more formal process such as mediation. the court will want to know what steps have been taken. if you think that it would be worthwhile you and the other party trying to negotiate a settlement at this stage you should tick the yes box. the court may order a stay, whether or not all the other parties to the claim agree. even if you are requesting a stay, you should still complete the rest of the questionnaire.more information about settlement options is available in the legal services commission leaflet alternatives to court free from any county court or the lsc leaflet line on 0845 3000 343. more information about mediation, the fees charged and a directory of mediation providers is available online from www.civilmediation.justice.gov.uk this service provides members of the public and businesses with

see: www.justice.gov.uk/guidance/courts-and-tribunals/ courts/procedure-rules/civil/menus/protocol.htm d case management information applicationsit is important for the court to know if you have

to include yourself as a witness of fact, if you will be giving evidence.expertsoral or written expert evidence will only be allowed at the trial or final hearing with the courts permission. the judge will decide what permission it seems appropriate to give when the claim is allocated to track. permission in small claims track cases will only be given exceptionally. trackthe basic guide by which claims are normally allocated to a track is the amount in dispute, although other factors such as the complexity of the case will also be considered. leaflet ex305 - the fast track and the

an appropriate case management track. to help the judge choose the most just and cost-effective track, you must now complete the attached questionnaire. if you fail to return the allocation questionnaire by the date given, the judge may make an order which leads to your claim being struck out, or hold an allocation hearing. if there is an allocation hearing the judge may order any party who has the costs of that hearing. if you wish to make an application, for example, for special directions, or for permission to add another party to the claim, you should send it and any required fee with the completed allocation application, it may also be used as an allocation hearing. any other documents you wish the judge to documents have been sent to the other party, or parties, saying when they would have received them and whether they agreed their contents. use a separate sheet if you need more space for your answers marking clearly which section the information refers to. write the case number on it, sign and date it and attach it securely to the questionnaire. the letters overleaf refer to the sections of the questionnaire and tell you what information is needed.a settlementunder the civil procedure rules parties should make every effort to settle their case before the hearing. this could be by discussion or negotiation (such as a roundtable meeting or settlement conference) or by a more formal process such as mediation. the court will want to know what steps have been taken. if you think that it would be worthwhile you and the other party trying to negotiate a settlement at this stage you should tick the yes box. the court may order a stay, whether or not all the other parties to the claim agree. even if you are requesting a stay, you should still complete the rest of the questionnaire.9mae mwy o wybodaeth am opsiynau setlo ar gael alternatives to court a geir yn rhad ac am ddim o unrhyw lys sirol neu drwy gysylltu llinell a godir,

writing. do not wait until just before the main hearing to ask the judge ill not want to delay the case unless it is absolutely necessary. if the documents or evidence are held by a third party you can make an application to the judge. you will need to say exactly what you want them to disclose and give reasons why you think the evidence is relevant. you will also need full contact details for the third party. if the judge makes the order s/he will give the third party a chance to say why they should not disclose the documents or evidence. again, it is important to make an application for disclosure as early as possible. the hearingoral hearing or paper determination the tribunal will hold an oral hearing to determine your appeal. however, the matter can be determined on the papers alone if you and the respondent consent and if the tribunal agrees. nearly all cases are held with the parties attending. suspension cases may be suitable for a paper hearing but in all cases where a factual dispute needs to be resolved, the tribunal will list the case for an oral hearing which the parties attend. at an oral hearing the panel may hear evidence from witnesses or may just hear from the parties this is sometimes referred to as a case conducted on submissions. the respondent will usually have a legal representative. this does not put them at an advantage. the judge and panel members are very used to dealing with self representing litigants (unrepresented people) and they will explain the procedure to you and make sure you have the opportunity to present your case. where an oral hearing is held it is in your interests to attend. if you fail to do so the tribunal can proceed without you. if this happens you wont have the opportunity to put your case or ask questions of the respondent as the hearing progresses. oral hearings are held in public except where the tribunal directs otherwise. the tribunal can also exclude persons from the hearing or part of the hearing if it has concerns that their attendance may have an adverse impact on the hearing. page 7representation at the hearing you can be represented at the hearing by anyone you choose, whether a lawyer or not. let both the tribunal and the other party know if you will be represented and if so, the name of your representative. services of an interpreter or signer if you need an interpreter or signer at the hearing for a witness or you, please let us know as soon as possible. we will arrange for one to be at the hearing. preparation for the hearing the decision-making party will usually be asked to prepare a bundle of papers for the hearing. the bundle will include all the documents you and the other party wish the appeal panel to consider. the respondent will send you your copy of the bundle. we will send you a guide to statements and bundles which sets out how to make a statement and what goes into the bundle. arranging the date(s) and venue the judge will set a date and time for the hearing at the telephone case management hearing. the venue will be confirmed at a later date. we try to ensure that the hearing is in your local area, and certainly within 2 hours travelling distance. if you live within reasonable travelling distance of central london, hearings will usually take place at 18 pocock street se1 0bw, which is close southwark tube station. otherwise, we will arrange a venue nearer to your home or business address. if you live in wales, your hearing will normally take place in cardiff or a suitable location elsewhere in wales. giving evidence you will be given the opportunity to put your case to the tribunal and may call any adult to give evidence on your behalf, although the judge has the power to restrict the number of witnesses. the tribunal can also require either party to provide expert evidence. children and vulnerable adults may only appear as witnesses in person if the tribunal considers it necessary to enable a fair hearing. in such cases the tribunal may appoint a person with appropriate skills or experience in facilitating the giving of evidence by children and vulnerable adults and may require the evidence to be given by telephone or video link. page 8when all the evidence has been heard, you and the respondent will have a chance to make closing remarks to the panel. this is an opportunity to highlight what you see as the important points in your case but you cannot introduce anything new at this stage. the decisionthe panel will then retire to consider its decision. the panel will not give you a decision on the day. the decision and reasons will be sent to you and the respondent in writing within 10 working days. the decision does not have to be unanimous. where the three members of the appeal panel cannot agree the majority view will prevail. the panel do not normally tell the parties whether the decision is unanimous or by majority unless they give reasons for the different views. the appeal panel will either uphold your appeal or direct that the appeal be dismissed. in some cases the panel may be minded to allow the appeal but impose conditions, for example in efficiency or cases of an application to join the list. the tribunal can dispose of an appeal by way of a consent order. such orders can only be made at the request of both parties if they are in agreement and only if it considers it appropriate. written decision made public reporting restrictions all primary health lists decisions are made public on our website, except to the extent that it is necessary to hold any details back to comply with a restricted reporting order. the tribunal can make an order restricting the publication of names to prevent you, patients, a child or vulnerable adult or any other person at the hearing being identified. if you want a restricted reporting order, you should raise it at the telephone hearing, send your request to the tribunal setting out your reasons or raise it with the panel. the full primary health lists decisions are published on the primary health lists website. application to set aside the decision you can ask the tribunal to set aside the decision if: a relevant document in your case was not received in time to be considered by the appeal panel you or your representative was not present at the hearing, or you think there was some irregularity in the proceedings. if you want to ask for the decision to be set aside, you must do so in writing within 28 days of receiving the decision. forms for the purpose are available on the website. page 9application to appeal the tribunals decision you can apply to appeal the decision of the tribunal to the upper tribunal. however, you must first apply to this tribunal asking for permission to appeal. you will not be granted permission to appeal simply on the basis that you dont agree with the decision. you must be able to show that the panel have made an error of law, and demonstrate what that error is. on receipt of an appeal application, the judge will first consider whether to review the decision based on your reasons for appeal. a fresh decision may be issued following a review, or if the tribunal grants you permission to appeal, your appeal will be forwarded to the upper tribunal to consider. if the tribunal decides that a review is not appropriate and if it refuses your application to appeal, you can make an application for permission to appeal direct to the upper tribunal. to do this you should contact: upper tribunal (administrative appeals chamber) 5th floor 7

02920 376460 withdrawal of appeal you can withdraw your appeal at any stage in the appeals process, but in most cases you need the tribunals consent for the case to be withdrawn. you need consent because there may be instances where the tribunal think it would be in the interests of justice that the case is heard. page 10if you want to withdraw, write or email to the tribunal explaining your reasons, copying your correspondence to the other party. you need to be aware that in withdrawing your case, the other party may apply for costs against you. please see under costs below. applications for costs are rare and are only successful if your conduct has been unreasonable. the earlier you withdraw an appeal the less likely an order for costs will be. the tribunal will always ask your views and your ability to pay before making an order for costs. once you withdraw your appeal, you can have your case re-instated with the consent of the tribunal. if you want your appeal re-instated you have to apply to the tribunal within 28 days of the notice of withdrawal or, if you withdraw at the hearing, within 28 days of the date of the hearing. the decision making body may also withdraw from the appeal at any time and if this happens you may be able to ask the tribunal to award you costs if you think they have acted unreasonably. striking out an appeal the tribunal can strike out your appeal or part of your case if you fail to comply with a direction or fail to co-operate to such an extent that the tribunal panel cannot conduct the proceedings fairly or justly. also, appeals where the tribunal has no jurisdiction will be struck out. exceptionally, an appeal can also be struck out by the tribunal if it thinks you have no reasonable prospect of success in your appeal or part of it. however, you will be given the opportunity to make representations before the appeal is struck out and you can ask for your appeal to be reinstated. any such application must be made in writing within 28 days of the date notifying you of the strike out. costs paying the other parties costs in some circumstances the tribunal can order you to pay all or some of the expenses incurred by the other party in responding to your appeal. but a costs order will only be made if the tribunal considers you have acted unreasonably in your conduct of the appeal. in considering if costs should be awarded, your financial circumstances will be taken in to account and you will be given the opportunity to make representations. costs can also be awarded to you by the other party for the same reasons. the tribunal does not award costs simply because you have lost your case. page 11 phl guide appealing to the first-tier tribunal (primary health lists) - a guide to the appeals procedures

send2-eng.txt," sen2 preparing the local authority case every child and local authority is different so the facts of each case are unique. this means that it is not helpful to suggest a rigid format for every la case. but there are points which apply generally which you will find helpful to consider whenever you draft a case statement and plan to present a case at a hearing. what the regulations require you to tell us the rules set out some legal requirements. these can be found in rule 21(2) of the hesc and practice direction 8 you can see the regulations in full at: www.sendist.gov.uk the authoritys response must say whether or not the la opposes the appeal. it must be signed by an authorised officer. if the la opposes the appeal there are five matters that have to be dealt with. if you find that you have a lot to say on some topics you can subdivide these headings. the rules say that the response must say: why the la opposes the appeal; the name and profession of the las representative and the las address to which documents are to be sent; a summary of the facts about the las decision; the reasons for the decision if these are not in the decision itself; and the childs views or the reason why the la has not got them. if you do not oppose the appeal, or fail to send us a response in time, we will decide the appeal on the parents notice or at a hearing which you would not attend. if you do not oppose the appeal or withdraw your opposition in certain cases the appeal is automatically treated as decided in favour of the parents. in these cases there is no need for the parents to withdraw the appeal and we will not make an order. if the appeal is about the contents of a statement and you do not oppose it (or at a later stage withdraw your opposition) you should send us in writing any changes you have agreed to make to the statement. power to strike out you can ask us to strike out the appeal if you believe it should not continue. the only grounds on which you can apply are those in rule 8. most commonly applications are on the grounds that parents are asking for an order which we are not empowered to make or that we are being asked to reconsider an earlier decision where the circumstances are unchanged. you must make an application to strike out on the so4 form, setting out your reasons in detail. we will send the parents a copy so they can comment on it. if the parents ask to make their comments verbally we will give both of you the chance to explain at a hearing why you feel the appeal should be struck out or continue. if your application is successful we will order the appeal to be struck out. this will bring it to an end. if your application is dismissed the appeal will continue and we will let you know how it will proceed. you may apply for a strike out at any time. if you make an application before the deadline for your response you should still send us a response by the date we have told you. the childs special educational needs the childs special educational needs are central to any case. we will want to see all the available expert reports, although in general tribunal panels will be most interested in the recent reports. you may want to draw attention to the important points in the response, but lengthy extracts are rarely necessary. the history of the case the tribunals decision necessarily relates to the childs current and future education, but earlier history may be relevant. a brief history helps to put the appeal in context. if you produce one, be selective. we dont need to know about every letter and telephone call between the la and the parents, but the timing of events affecting the child can be important. for example give the dates of assessments by professionals, when the child started school and then changed schools, and how long particular types of provision lasted. the childs progress, or lack of it, is often a key issue. in considering this it is useful to have reports on assessments made over a period of time, school reports and individual education plans, or equivalent records of additional or different provision and outcomes, so we can measure change the present position the tribunal needs to form an accurate current picture of the child. the matters covered depend on the nature of the case, but they should be up-to-date and detailed. they may include: current educational attainments and end of key stage results; behaviour at school (and at home); latest assessments by people from school or external agencies; details of current educational provision and, if relevant, non-educational provision; or travel arrangements to and from school. you can say which current arrangements are successful and which are proving to be less effective. if for any reason the child is not actually receiving all the provision which is intended, please give details. the childs views you must include a statement of the childs own views or explain why this is not possible. the views may be included in the las response or on the issues in the appeal or they may be set in a separate document. some las engage independent people to obtain the childs views. occasionally the age or the special needs of the child makes it difficult for the la to elicit the childs views, or the authority may not have access to him or her. in these circumstances the response must explain why it does not give the childs views. the child can go to part or all of the appeal hearing, even where the papers contain a statement of his or her views. if you think that the childs presence is likely to affect the presentation of any part of the las case, explain why to the panel at the hearing. legal requirements your response should address any legal requirements which apply to the appeal. here are two common considerations. if the parents have expressed a preference for a placement in a maintained school (education act 1996, schedule 27, paragraphs 3 or 8), the la is only entitled to oppose it for one or more of the following three reasons: the placement is unsuitable for the child; it would affect the education of others; or it would be an inefficient use of resources. you should say which of these reasons you rely on and provide evidence to demonstrate them. you should have in mind that children with special educational needs will normally be educated in mainstream schools (education act 1996, section 316, 316a, as amended by the sen & disability act 2001). the la has a duty to provide education in a mainstream school unless parents have indicated that they do not want their child to be educated in a mainstream school, or unless you are able to demonstrate that this would either be incompatible with the efficient education of other children or that the child should not be educated in a mainstream school. points at issue appeals only reach us if the la and the parents disagree, but it is quite in order for discussions to continue after the appeal has been made. you may decide to use disagreement resolution arrangements. however, it should not normally be necessary to delay the hearing because negotiations have not finished. the las response can usefully identify where agreement has not been possible. you should set out the las position clearly, with reasons. sen code of practice we must take into account the provision set out in the code of practice. you should consider the advice provided by the code and ensure your response reflects the provision that is relevant to the appeal. you should also explain any departure from the codes relevant provision. la policies we will take la policies into account if they are set out in the written evidence or explained verbally. but you cannot assume that an la decision that was made in line with its policy will necessarily be approved by the tribunal (if it were the case there would be no need for a tribunal). we will seriously consider local policies, particularly if you explain why they were adopted and how they reflect national policy and guidance. summaries summaries of the evidence can help in presenting of the las case. examples are: details of changes to the childs statement that have been agreed with the parents, or a comparison of placement costs. schools we need basic evidence about any school or other type of placement we are asked to consider. where the appeal is about the school named in the statement we will include separate guidance (sen14) setting out the information we need. you should make sure your response deals with the matters we raise in this guidance academies, city technology colleges and schools maintained by another authority where an academy, ctc or an out-of-authority maintained school is proposed by parents it is important that the views of these institutions are represented in your response and that they are able to attend tribunals. section 2 of our attendance form guidance (sen5) gives advice on witnesses. therapy if therapy is proposed, is this for educational reasons?

send4-eng.txt,"you should send with the claim copies of any documents which might help the tribunal to understand what the claim is about. this can include correspondence, copies of documents sent from the school, or written statements from people who witnessed events. the school must also send copies of all relevant documents which it has in its possession (though it is asked not to duplicate things you have already provided), and must send these to you and the tribunal when it sends in the response to the claim. you can send in more documents after seeing the schools response, and you will be told the latest date to do this.it is the schools responsibility to prepare a set of all relevant papers for the final hearing, this will contain all relevant documents including copies of your documents - set out in a logical order and will be copied to you and the tribunal. this set of papers is usually referred to as the hearing bundle.putting things right you will be asked to tell us what you would like to happen if the tribunal decides that there has been discrimination. the tribunal can order actions that will help make up for any opportunities that you have missed or prevent future discrimination. examples include: training of school staff drawing up new guidance for staff changes to school policies page 10 extra tuition, to make up for lost learning changing the location of lessons or activities (but not changing physical premises) admission to an independent school if the school has previously refused a written apology trips or other opportunities to make up for activities that you may have missed in cases of permanent exclusion, an order reinstating you at the school withdrawal of an exclusion from your school records the equality act 2010 does not allow the tribunal to make an order for payment of compensation. the tribunal has no power to enforce its orders. normally, if you think the school has failed to comply, the complaint has to be made to the secretary of state. more about the claim form you start a claim by sending in a completed claim form. the form is available from the tribunal or can be downloaded from the website: www.justice.gov.uk/tribunals/send . this form tells you what information is needed about the claim and your childs disability. if you need more space you can continue on separate pages. the form must be signed by you, or on your behalf by a qualified lawyer. a representative who is not a qualified lawyer cannot sign the form on your behalf. if you are sending the claim form electronically, you or your representative can type your name where a signature is required. as a claimant you are called a party. the tribunal cannot communicate about your claim with a person who is not a party, even your parent, without the permission of the party, because all information held by the tribunal about the claim is confidential. there are two claim forms for a young person making a claim (and two a parent who wants to make a claim about a child) and you must use the correct form. remember, your claim must normally reach the tribunal within 6 months of the alleged discrimination.page 11 section 3 after we receive your claim what happens next depends on whether or not you are asking the tribunal to order the school to reinstate you.you want to be reinstated after a permanent exclusion a permanent exclusion decision is initially made by the schools headteacher. however, the tribunal has no jurisdiction to accept a claim relating to a permanent exclusion in a state school unless the governing body has met and has decided to uphold that decision. at that point the tribunal can operate a fast-track procedure which aims to ensure you get a decision on your claim within five to six weeks of receipt of your claim.we cannot fast-track a claim for a permanent exclusion from a state school until the exclusion is confirmed by the governing body. similarly, the fast-track procedure for getting a quick hearing on a permanent exclusion claim is not available if you have applied to the local authoritys independent review panel and you are still waiting for the panels recommendation. the fast-track procedure becomes available if, after that review, you have not been reinstated. you will need to tell us on the claim form if your parent has made a review application. if you have, we will stay the claim until you tell us the outcome of the review, which means it is put on hold until then.once the permanent exclusion claim is registered as a fast-track claim, the following timetable will apply. if your claim reaches the tribunal before midday we register it the same day and the fast-track timetable is started. if it arrives after that time the fast-track timetable is started the next day. as soon as we register your claim we send a copy with the documents you sent us to the school. the school has 18 working days from when we register the claim to get its response back to the tribunal. the registration letter will include directions to you and the school setting out the other important dates leading up to the hearing, including the latest date to send in additional documents. you will have a chance to respond to anything the school says in its response to your claim.it is important not to change this timetable, as it is not in your interests for any decision on reinstatement to be delayed. however the registration directions will explain how you or the school can apply if you or the school want to change the timetable.you are not requesting an order for you to be reinstated after a permanent exclusion we will register your claim within 10 working days of receiving it, and send a copy, together with copies of the documents you sent with the claim, to the school. we will notify you when the claim is registered and tell you the date the hearing will take place, and when the schools response to your claim must be received. we will tell you when the school has to send in a response to the claim. we will also send you an approximate date for case management of your claim, which occurs after we have received the schools response. we

sscs1a-(large-print)-eng.txt,"3. making your appeal the lawthe law has certain rules about appeals and hmcts can only accept your appeal if it meets these legal criteria. your appeal must: be made in writing; be in english or welsh; include with it a copy of the mandatory reconsideration notice (or notices if there is more than one); 11 give reasons for the appeal; and, be signed by you, unless dwp or a court has appointed someone else to act on your behalf. if your appeal does not meet all these criteria hmcts may have to return it to you and may not be able to consider your appeal at all unless you provide these details. because of the legal requirement to include specic information hmcts strongly recommend that you use an appeal form to make your appeal. the form helps you gather the right information in a step-by-step way and has a checklist you can use to make sure that everything is included. details of where you may obtain this are provided overleaf and on the justice website. the form also asks you questions about what type of hearing you would like, dates you would like us to avoid and whether you have any special needs. if you prefer, you can still make your appeal just by writing a letter, but you risk missing out some of the information the law requires. also, hmcts may have to write out to you separately to ask about your hearing requirements and availability and this creates a delay in the process. if you want to appeal by writing your own letter, use the appeal form as your guide and include in your letter all the things that the appeal form asks for. 12 time-limitsfor social security and child support appeals you have one calendar month from the date when the mandatory reconsideration notice was sent to you in which to appeal. your appeal is not regarded as made, until it has been received by hmcts. for example, if the letter giving the decision is sent to you on 15 march, your appeal must arrive in hmcts by 15 april at the latest. if you nd yourself outside the time-limit, you must give reasons why the appeal is late. if you do not provide reasons your appeal may be returned to you. there is a special section on the appeal form where you can give reasons for lateness. please remember, if the time limit is very soon your appeal may be late by the time it arrives in hmcts, even if it is not late on the day you post it. if dwp do not object to the reasons for your appeal being late it will generally proceed as though it was received in time. we will write to you if dwp object to your appeal being late. in child maintenance cases, the other party involved in the appeal can also raise an objection to the late appeal. the appeal form hmcts strongly recommend that you use an appeal form to make your appeal. the form will help you record the type of information you require in a simple step-by-step process. 13there are three types of appeal form depending on the type of appeal you are making. these are: form sscs1 for social security benets decisions; form sscs2 for child support/maintenance decisions; and, form sscs3 for compensation recovery decisions. form sscs1 is the form to be used by most people making an appeal as more than 95% of appeals against dwp decisions concern entitlement to different types of benet. you can obtain forms: from the website www.justice.gov.uk; or, from the gov.uk website at www.gov.uk ; or, visiting local independent advice agencies who may stock the form. if you need advice on completing the appeal form you may call hmcts on 0300 123 1142 if you live in england or wales or 0141 354 8400 if you live in scotland. in the next section instructions are provided on how to complete form sscs1. a separate section is also provided which gives guidance on how to complete forms sscs2 showing how this form is different and what additional information is required. guidance on completion of form sscs3 can be downloaded from the hmcts website at www.justice.gov.uk 14 4. completing form sscs1 not all parts of the form need to be completed by everybody. people making appeals have different circumstances, so you may nd that you only need to complete some sections of the form. everyone , however, must complete sections 1, 2, 5, 6 and 8. you should use black ink to complete the form. this is because the form must be photocopied by hmcts and sent to dwp and coloured ink, even blue ink, does not show up well in photocopies. you should also complete the form using block capitals so that all the important details are clear unless the section on the form tells you otherwise. if your appeal relates to a universal credit joint claim, you should consider the involvement of the other person in the claim with regard to the appeal when completing the form. section 1 about the decision you are appealing againstsection 1 is all about the decision you are appealing against. it is helpful if you have a copy of your decision letter, the mandatory reconsideration notice, to hand when you are completing this part of the form. the law says you can only appeal against certain decisions and that you must include a copy of the mandatory 15reconsideration notice with the appeal. this section helps you make sure you do that. in this section you need to: tick the box to show that you are enclosing a copy of the mandatory reconsideration notice; and, tick the box to show if your decision letter says that you have the right of appeal. you can only appeal against a decision which carries the right of appeal. your decision letter will tell you this. if you tick no to this question, you should only do so if you are sure that your decision legally carries the right of appeal. hmcts will ask a judge to check this for you and will let you know the outcome. section 2 about you this section is all about you. when we are referring to you we mean the person who the mandatory reconsideration notice was addressed to who is making the appeal. here we need you to tell us who you are and where you live so that we can write to you and so that dwp can identify who you are when we ask them to explain why they came to their decision in your case. in this section you will need to: give your title, rst name(s) and surname; give your date of birth; give your national insurance number; 16 give your address; give your daytime phone number; and, give your mobile phone number (if you have one). when we say title, we mean things like mr, mrs or miss. your phone number will be helpful to us if we need to contact you at short notice, for example if a hearing date becomes available sooner than we expected or if it is easier to explain something to you by telephone rather than in writing. section 3 about a child or other person you are appealing for this section is all about a person you are appealing on behalf of. you only need to complete this section if you are appealing on behalf of someone whose affairs you are looking after. this could be a child you are the parent of or it might be an adult who is unable to manage their benets for themselves. if the person is an adult, you must have been formally appointed to act on their behalf by dwp, or by a court, because of the persons condition. if you are just helping the person with their appeal in an informal arrangement, you will be acting as their representative and will need to complete section 4 instead. section 3 should only be used to record the 17details of a person who you have a legal responsibility for. in this section you will need to: give the title, rst name and surname of the person you are appealing for; give their date of birth; give their national insurance number; and, give their address. remember, this section is just for a person you have a legal responsibility for. you should not complete this section if you are acting as the persons representative. section 4 about your representative (if you have one) this section is all about your representative, if you have one. not everyone has a representative and if you do not have one you can skip this section and move straight to section 5. if your appeal is regarding a universal credit joint claim, it would be helpful to make it clear that the representative is representing you jointly. you are entitled to have a representative of your choice, but you must make the arrangements for this yourself. your representative does not have to be legally qualied. he or she could be a friend or relative, but 18 bear in mind that your representative will be provided with evidence relevant to the appeal, such as medical reports which you may regard as condential. in choosing a representative, you should bear in mind what the role of a tribunal representative is. a good representative should be able to: advise you on what kind of evidence will help your case; obtain that evidence for you or assist you to obtain it; liaise with dwp to see if the case can be settled without going to a tribunal hearing; research the law; prepare a written statement for the tribunal summarising your case; advise you on related matters, including other benets; and, deal with the consequences of the tribunals decision, favourable or otherwise. you are only likely to get such support from a trained representative from a reputable agency. a poor representative can actually damage your prospects of success. most people who have a representative are represented by a professional organisation such as an advice centre or welfare rights service. 19in this section on the form you will need to: give the name and address of the organisation or person representing you; give the phone number of the organisation or person; and, give the name of the person in the organisation representing you (if you know this). we will contact your representative about your appeal and tell them things like hearing dates and we will ask dwp to send them as well as you a copy of the papers relating to your appeal. if you want to have a representative, but have not managed to get in touch with an advice agency yet, you may still submit your appeal and tell us when you have a representative at a later stage, however, you must do this in writing. this is because we need your written consent to take instructions from a person acting on your behalf. often your representative will arrange this for you. please remember, even if you have a representative, the tribunal at the hearing will almost certainly want to speak directly with you, person-to-person, asking you questions and listening to your answers. this is because you will have rst-hand knowledge and experience of the things the tribunal will most want to hear, whereas your representative would only be able to give a second-hand version. 20 section 5 about your appeal this section is about the reasons for your appeal and, if it applies, the reasons why your appeal is late. grounds for appeal the section is all about the reasons or grounds for your appeal and whether your appeal is within the time limit. in the section headed grounds for appeal you should write down the reasons why you think the decision is wrong. you do not need to complete this section in block capitals. your reasons do not have to be lengthy or written in legal language, but you need to say more than just, i disagree. you should explain simply why you think the decision you are appealing against is incorrect. it might be useful for you to state what you consider the correct decision should be. the more specic you are about the points of dispute, the easier it is for the tribunal to understand what your grievance is and to focus their attention on this before the hearing. for example, in an appeal regarding universal credit, it is helpful to write down which elements of the universal credit award you disagree with. these are the composite parts of the universal credit award which are intended to reect your households needs. you are welcome to attach evidence which you feel may be supportive to your appeal, but you should not delay appealing while you obtain this. 21if you need more space to write your reasons you can attach a separate sheet of paper. is your appeal in time? ","11 give reasons for the appeal; and, be signed by you, unless dwp or a court has appoi"
sscs1a-(large-print)-eng.txt,"the second part of section 5 asks you to conrm whether your appeal is in time. the earlier section in this booklet, time limits , tells you more about how these are worked out and you may want to refer back to this to check the details. your appeal will be considered late if it is received in hmcts more than one calendar month after the date on the mandatory reconsideration notice. if your appeal is late, or if it will be late by the time hmcts receive it, you must provide reasons why it is late. if your appeal is received late and no reasons are provided, hmcts will return the appeal to you. use this section here to record reasons for lateness if this applies. you do not need to complete this section in block capitals. an appeal received late with reasons for lateness provided will be treated by hmcts as being received in time, unless dwp raises an objection to it. if an objection is received, we may send a copy of it to you and may invite you to comment on it before referring it to a judge. the judge will review your case and decide if there are any merits in the arguments. in child maintenance cases, the other party involved in the appeal can also raise an objection to the late appeal. 22 we will write to you if anyone objects to the reasons for the appeal being late. section 6 about your choice of hearingthis section is all about how you would like the tribunal to make a decision on your appeal. normally, hmcts will arrange a hearing for your appeal and you or your representative will be expected to attend. hmcts call this having an oral hearing. at an oral hearing, you, and your representative, if you have one, will be given the opportunity to meet the tribunal and put forward your case in person and to answer any questions the tribunal may have. dwp also have the right to attend the oral hearing and put forward their case. the tribunal can also direct which type of hearing takes place. the alternative to an oral hearing is having your case decided by the tribunal without a hearing. neither you nor dwp (nor the other party in child maintenance appeals or the joint party in a universal credit joint appeal) will attend and the tribunal will come to its decision alone on the basis of what is in the appeal papers. the tribunal will consider your letter of appeal, any supporting evidence you have provided and the dwps response to your appeal. hmcts refer to this as having a paper hearing, though it is not strictly 23speaking a hearing. a paper hearing will take place if all parties agree to it and no-one has asked for an oral hearing. dwp is also given the opportunity to express their preference for the type of hearing they would like. an oral hearing will only be arranged if: you ask for an oral hearing; or, dwp asks for an oral hearing; or, another party to the appeal asks for an oral hearing; or, the tribunal itself decides that an oral hearing would be more appropriate than deciding the case on the papers. if you change your mind after returning the enquiry form and want to switch from having your case decided on the papers to having an oral hearing, or vice-versa, please tell hmcts as soon as possible. as long as you have not been given a hearing date, you can do this by phone. if you have received a hearing date, however, you will need to put this in writing. it is too late to change after the tribunal has made its decision on your appeal. one thing you are likely to want to know, when deciding whether to choose a hearing or not, is where your appeal hearing would take place. hmcts holds appeal hearings at a national network of over 100 locations throughout england, scotland and wales. 24 there is a tribunal venue in most cities and towns. hmcts will try to arrange for your hearing to take place at the venue that is nearest to you. please contact us in writing if the venue we offer you would not be convenient. a list of all venues is available on our website www.justice.gov.uk in child maintenance appeals, where the parents may live in different parts of the country, we will try to come to the fairest arrangement. the nal say on choice of venue, if there is disagreement, rests in the hands of the tribunal. if you would prefer a hearing but you would be unable to travel to the tribunal venue, because you are so severely disabled that you are housebound, you can request what is called an out-of-centre hearing. this would involve the exceptional step of the tribunal hearing your appeal at your home or at an alternative location. a request for an out-of-centre hearing should be supported by a letter from your doctor conrming that you are unable to travel at all, even by taxi. virtually all our tribunal venues have access for people with disabilities. if you want conrmation that the venue you will be using is suitable to your own individual needs, you will have the opportunity to indicate your requirements in section 7 of the appeal form. once you have decided what type of hearing you want, tick the box to make your choice on the form. there are 25two choices: i want to attend a hearing of my appeal or i want my appeal decided on the papers tick one of the boxes to make your choice. if you have ticked the box to say that you want to attend a hearing, you should move on to section 7. if you ticked the box to say that you want your appeal decided on the papers, you can skip section 7 completely and go straight to section 8. section 7 oral hearings your needs and requirements this section is all about your needs and requirements for an oral hearing. if you do not want an oral hearing, you should skip this section. if you need to write in any of the boxes in this section you do not need to use block capitals. for universal credit appeals where the claim is a joint claim, the needs and requirements of the partner in the claim should also be considered as the tribunal may expect them to also attend a hearing question 1 your availability because you want to be present at the hearing, you should write down here any dates or times you would be unavailable for a hearing. this might be a regular date when you are unavailable, for example, every thursday, because of domestic or other 26 commitments or you might be aware of specic dates you will be unavailable, such as hospital appointments or booked holidays. you should consider unavailability for 6 months ahead. remember, you can always tell hmcts of any changes to your availability by telephoning or writing to us. question 2 your needs we need to make sure your hearing takes place in a location which is suitable for you and that you can access easily. please tell us in this section about any particular needs you may have. this might be something like a hearing loop or special requirements because of a disability or mobility issue. question 3 your signer/interpreter and language requirements please let us know here whether you (or the joint party in a universal credit joint appeal) require an interpreter to assist you at the hearing. like the courts, tribunals insist on using independent, professional interpreters and signers. relying on a friend or relative is not acceptable. your interpreter could be a person who interprets verbally to translate english into another language or this could be a sign interpreter who translates spoken words into british sign language. if you tick yes in this section you must also record the language and dialect you require. 27when hmcts arrange your hearing, we will ensure that an interpreter is provided who meets your needs. question 4 your notice of hearing the law requires hmcts to give you a minimum of 14 days notice of your hearing. this gives you enough time to prepare for your hearing, but it also prevents hmcts from offering you a hearing date which becomes available at short notice because of, for example, a cancellation. if you prefer, we can also give you less notice than 14 days, but only if you agree to this. if you have a representative, you may want to discuss this matter with them as they may need to have 14 days notice of any hearing. this does not mean that we will only give you less than 14 days notice of the hearing, but it means that we can do if an earlier date is available. if you agree to receiving less than 14 days notice of your hearing, please tick the yes box here, otherwise tick no. if you have ticked yes, please make sure that you have provided your phone number in section 1 as we will need to telephone you to arrange a short notice hearing. section 8 your signature this section is for your signature. it is a legal requirement for your appeal to be signed. please sign your name here, write your name in block capitals in the 28 box underneath and record the date that you signed the form in the box provided. if you do not sign your appeal form, hmcts may have to return the appeal to you for you to sign it. if you have named a representative at section 4, signing the appeal form will also give hmcts your permission to correspond with them and discuss your appeal with them should the need arise. what to do now where to send your appeal this section tells you where to send your appeal. where you send your appeal depends on where you live. there are two addresses to send your appeal to and these are shown on the appeal form. if you live in england or wales, you should send your appeal form to: hmcts sscs appeals centre po box 1203 bradford bd1 9wp if you live in scotland, you should send your appeal to: hmcts sscs appeals centre po box 27080 glasgow g2 9hq 29you will require a stamped addressed envelope to do this which you must provide yourself. if you are currently living overseas, you should send your appeal to the hmcts ofce which would normally handle your appeal based on: your point of entry into great britain if you have opted for an oral hearing; or the place where you were previously resident in great britain if you do not intend to attend a hearing. checking the appeal form checklistthere is a checklist at the end of the appeal form. you do not have to use this, but it will help you to make sure that you have provided all the information required. alternative formats this part of the form gives you the numbers to call if you require the appeal form in an alternative format

sscs1a-eng.txt,"73. making your appeal the lawthe law has certain rules about appeals and hmcts can only accept your appeal if it meets these legal criteria. your appeal must: be made in writing; be in english or welsh; include with it a copy of the mandatory reconsideration notice (or notices if there is more than one); give reasons for the appeal; and, be signed by you, unless dwp or a court has appointed someone else to act on your behalf. if your appeal does not meet all these criteria hmcts may have to return it to you and may not be able to consider your appeal at all unless you provide these details. because of the legal requirement to include specic information hmcts strongly recommend that you use an appeal form to make your appeal. the form helps you gather the right information in a step-by-step way and has a checklist you can use to make sure that everything is included. details of where you may obtain this are provided overleaf and on the justice website. the form also asks you questions about what type of hearing you would like, dates you would like us to avoid and whether you have any special needs. if you prefer, you can still make your appeal just by writing a letter, but you risk missing out some of the information the law requires. also, hmcts may have to write out to you separately to ask about your hearing requirements and availability and this creates a delay in the process. if you want to appeal by writing your own letter, use the appeal form as your guide and include in your letter all the things that the appeal form asks for. time-limitsfor social security and child support appeals you have one calendar month from the date when the mandatory reconsideration notice was sent to you in which to appeal. your appeal is not regarded as made, until it has been received by hmcts. for example, if the letter giving the decision is sent to you on 15 march, your appeal must arrive in hmcts by 15 april at the latest. if you nd yourself outside the time-limit, you must give reasons why the appeal is late. if you do not provide reasons your appeal may be returned to you. there is a special section on the appeal form where you can give reasons for lateness. please remember, if the time limit is very soon your appeal may be late by the time it arrives in hmcts, even if it is not late on the day you post it. 8 if dwp do not object to the reasons for your appeal being late it will generally proceed as though it was received in time. we will write to you if dwp object to your appeal being late. in child maintenance cases, the other party involved in the appeal can also raise an objection to the late appeal. the appeal form hmcts strongly recommend that you use an appeal form to make your appeal. the form will help you record the type of information you require in a simple step-by-step process. there are three types of appeal form depending on the type of appeal you are making. these are: form sscs1 for social security benets decisions; form sscs2 for child support/maintenance decisions; and, form sscs3 for compensation recovery decisions. form sscs1 is the form to be used by most people making an appeal as more than 95% of appeals against dwp decisions concern entitlement to different types of benet. you can obtain forms: from the website www.justice.gov.uk; or, from the gov.uk website at www.gov.uk ; or, visiting local independent advice agencies who may stock the form. if you need advice on completing the appeal form you may call hmcts on 0300 123 1142 if you live in england or wales or 0141 354 8400 if you live in scotland. in the next section instructions are provided on how to complete form sscs1. a separate section is also provided which gives guidance on how to complete forms sscs2 showing how this form is different and what additional information is required. guidance on completion of form sscs3 can be downloaded from the hmcts website at www.justice.gov.uk 4. completing form sscs1 not all parts of the form need to be completed by everybody. people making appeals have different circumstances, so you may nd that you only need to complete some sections of the form. everyone , however, must complete sections 1, 2, 5, 6 and 8. you should use black ink to complete the form. this is because the form must be photocopied by hmcts and sent to dwp and coloured ink, even blue ink, does not show up well in photocopies. you should also complete the form using block capitals so that all the important details are clear unless the section on the form tells you otherwise. if your appeal relates to a universal credit joint claim, you should consider the involvement of the other person in the claim with regard to the appeal when completing the form. 9section 1 about the decision you are appealing against section 1 is all about the decision you are appealing against. it is helpful if you have a copy of your decision letter, the mandatory reconsideration notice, to hand when you are completing this part of the form. the law says you can only appeal against certain decisions and that you must include a copy of the mandatory reconsideration notice with the appeal. this section helps you make sure you do that. in this section you need to: tick the box to show that you are enclosing a copy of the mandatory reconsideration notice; and, tick the box to show if your decision letter says that you have the right of appeal. you can only appeal against a decision which carries the right of appeal. your decision letter will tell you this. if you tick no to this question, you should only do so if you are sure that your decision legally carries the right of appeal. hmcts will ask a judge to check this for you and will let you know the outcome. section 2 about you this section is all about you. when we are referring to you we mean the person who the mandatory reconsideration notice was addressed to who is making the appeal. here we need you to tell us who you are and where you live so that we can write to you and so that dwp can identify who you are when we ask them to explain why they came to their decision in your case. in this section you will need to: give your title, rst name(s) and surname; give your date of birth; give your national insurance number; give your address; give your daytime phone number; and, give your mobile phone number (if you have one). when we say title, we mean things like mr, mrs or miss. your phone number will be helpful to us if we need to contact you at short notice, for example if a hearing date becomes available sooner than we expected or if it is easier to explain something to you by telephone rather than in writing. 10 section 3 about a child or other person you are appealing forthis section is all about a person you are appealing on behalf of. you only need to complete this section if you are appealing on behalf of someone whose affairs you are looking after. this could be a child you are the parent of or it might be an adult who is unable to manage their benets for themselves. if the person is an adult, you must have been formally appointed to act on their behalf by dwp, or by a court, because of the persons condition. if you are just helping the person with their appeal in an informal arrangement, you will be acting as their representative and will need to complete section 4 instead. section 3 should only be used to record the details of a person who you have a legal responsibility for. in this section you will need to: give the title, rst name and surname of the person you are appealing for; give their date of birth; give their national insurance number; and, give their address. remember, this section is just for a person you have a legal responsibility for. you should not complete this section if you are acting as the persons representative. section 4 about your representative (if you have one) this section is all about your representative, if you have one. not everyone has a representative and if you do not have one you can skip this section and move straight to section 5. if your appeal is regarding a universal credit joint claim, it would be helpful to make it clear that the representative is representing you jointly. you are entitled to have a representative of your choice, but you must make the arrangements for this yourself. your representative does not have to be legally qualied. he or she could be a friend or relative, but bear in mind that your representative will be provided with evidence relevant to the appeal, such as medical reports which you may regard as condential. in choosing a representative, you should bear in mind what the role of a tribunal representative is. a good representative should be able to: advise you on what kind of evidence will help your case;

give the phone number of the organisation or person; and, give the name of the person in the organisation representing you (if you know this). we will contact your representative about your appeal and tell them things like hearing dates and we will ask dwp to send them as well as you a copy of the papers relating to your appeal. if you want to have a representative, but have not managed to get in touch with an advice agency yet, you may still submit your appeal and tell us when you have a representative at a later stage, however, you must do this in writing. this is because we need your written consent to take instructions from a person acting on your behalf. often your representative will arrange this for you. please remember, even if you have a representative, the tribunal at the hearing will almost certainly want to speak directly with you, person-to-person, asking you questions and listening to your answers. this is because you will have rst-hand knowledge and experience of the things the tribunal will most want to hear, whereas your representative would only be able to give a second-hand version. section 5 about your appeal this section is about the reasons for your appeal and, if it applies, the reasons why your appeal is late. grounds for appeal the section is all about the reasons or grounds for your appeal and whether your appeal is within the time limit. in the section headed grounds for appeal you should write down the reasons why you think the decision is wrong. you do not need to complete this section in block capitals. your reasons do not have to be lengthy or written in legal language, but you need to say more than just, i disagree. you should explain simply why you think the decision you are appealing against is incorrect. it might be useful for you to state what you consider the correct decision should be. the more specic you are about the points of dispute, the easier it is for the tribunal to understand what your grievance is and to focus their attention on this before the hearing. for example, in an appeal regarding universal credit, it is helpful to write down which elements of the universal credit award you disagree with. these are the composite parts 12 of the universal credit award which are intended to reect your households needs. you are welcome to attach evidence which you feel may be supportive to your appeal, but you should not delay appealing while you obtain this. if you need more space to write your reasons you can attach a separate sheet of paper. is your appeal in time? ","); give reasons for the appeal; and, be signed by you, unless dwp or a court has appoi"
sscs1a-eng.txt,"the second part of section 5 asks you to conrm whether your appeal is in time. the earlier section in this booklet, time limits , tells you more about how these are worked out and you may want to refer back to this to check the details. your appeal will be considered late if it is received in hmcts more than one calendar month after the date on the mandatory reconsideration notice. if your appeal is late, or if it will be late by the time hmcts receive it, you must provide reasons why it is late. if your appeal is received late and no reasons are provided, hmcts will return the appeal to you. use this section here to record reasons for lateness if this applies. you do not need to complete this section in block capitals. an appeal received late with reasons for lateness provided will be treated by hmcts as being received in time, unless dwp raises an objection to it. if an objection is received, we may send a copy of it to you and may invite you to comment on it before referring it to a judge. the judge will review your case and decide if there are any merits in the arguments. in child maintenance cases, the other party involved in the appeal can also raise an objection to the late appeal. we will write to you if anyone objects to the reasons for the appeal being late. section 6 about your choice of hearing this section is all about how you would like the tribunal to make a decision on your appeal. normally, hmcts will arrange a hearing for your appeal and you or your representative will be expected to attend. hmcts call this having an oral hearing. at an oral hearing, you, and your representative, if you have one, will be given the opportunity to meet the tribunal and put forward your case in person and to answer any questions the tribunal may have. dwp also have the right to attend the oral hearing and put forward their case. the tribunal can also direct which type of hearing takes place. the alternative to an oral hearing is having your case decided by the tribunal without a hearing. neither you nor dwp (nor the other party in child maintenance appeals or the joint party in a universal credit joint appeal) will attend and the tribunal will come to its decision alone on the basis of what is in the appeal papers. the tribunal will consider your letter of appeal, any supporting evidence you have provided and the dwps response to your appeal. hmcts refer to this as having a paper hearing, though it is not strictly speaking a hearing. a paper hearing will take place if all parties agree to it and no-one has asked for an oral hearing. 13dwp is also given the opportunity to express their preference for the type of hearing they would like. an oral hearing will only be arranged if: you ask for an oral hearing; or, dwp asks for an oral hearing; or, another party to the appeal asks for an oral hearing; or, the tribunal itself decides that an oral hearing would be more appropriate than deciding the case on the papers. if you change your mind after returning the enquiry form and want to switch from having your case decided on the papers to having an oral hearing, or vice-versa, please tell hmcts as soon as possible. as long as you have not been given a hearing date, you can do this by phone. if you have received a hearing date, however, you will need to put this in writing. it is too late to change after the tribunal has made its decision on your appeal. one thing you are likely to want to know, when deciding whether to choose a hearing or not, is where your appeal hearing would take place. hmcts holds appeal hearings at a national network of over 100 locations throughout england, scotland and wales. there is a tribunal venue in most cities and towns. hmcts will try to arrange for your hearing to take place at the venue that is nearest to you. please contact us in writing if the venue we offer you would not be convenient. a list of all venues is available on our website www.justice.gov.uk in child maintenance appeals, where the parents may live in different parts of the country, we will try to come to the fairest arrangement. the nal say on choice of venue, if there is disagreement, rests in the hands of the tribunal. if you would prefer a hearing but you would be unable to travel to the tribunal venue, because you are so severely disabled that you are housebound, you can request what is called an out-of-centre hearing. this would involve the exceptional step of the tribunal hearing your appeal at your home or at an alternative location. a request for an out-of-centre hearing should be supported by a letter from your doctor conrming that you are unable to travel at all, even by taxi. virtually all our tribunal venues have access for people with disabilities. if you want conrmation that the venue you will be using is suitable to your own individual needs, you will have the opportunity to indicate your requirements in section 7 of the appeal form. once you have decided what type of hearing you want, tick the box to make your choice on the form. there are two choices: i want to attend a hearing of my appeal or i want my appeal decided on the papers tick one of the boxes to make your choice. if you have ticked the box to say that you want to attend a hearing, you should move on 14 to section 7. if you ticked the box to say that you want your appeal decided on the papers, you can skip section 7 completely and go straight to section 8. section 7 oral hearings your needs and requirements this section is all about your needs and requirements for an oral hearing. if you do not want an oral hearing, you should skip this section. if you need to write in any of the boxes in this section you do not need to use block capitals. for universal credit appeals where the claim is a joint claim, the needs and requirements of the partner in the claim should also be considered as the tribunal may expect them to also attend a hearing question 1 your availability because you want to be present at the hearing, you should write down here any dates or times you would be unavailable for a hearing. this might be a regular date when you are unavailable, for example, every thursday, because of domestic or other commitments or you might be aware of specic dates you will be unavailable, such as hospital appointments or booked holidays. you should consider unavailability for 6 months ahead. remember, you can always tell hmcts of any changes to your availability by telephoning or writing to us. question 2 your needs we need to make sure your hearing takes place in a location which is suitable for you and that you can access easily. please tell us in this section about any particular needs you may have. this might be something like a hearing loop or special requirements because of a disability or mobility issue. question 3 your signer/interpreter and language requirements please let us know here whether you (or the joint party in a universal credit joint appeal) require an interpreter to assist you at the hearing. like the courts, tribunals insist on using independent, professional interpreters and signers. relying on a friend or relative is not acceptable. your interpreter could be a person who interprets verbally to translate english into another language or this could be a sign interpreter who translates spoken words into british sign language. if you tick yes in this section you must also record the language and dialect you require. when hmcts arrange your hearing, we will ensure that an interpreter is provided who meets your needs. question 4 your notice of hearing the law requires hmcts to give you a minimum of 14 days notice of your hearing. this gives you enough time to prepare for your hearing, but it also prevents hmcts from offering you a hearing date which becomes available at short notice because of, for example, a cancellation. if you prefer, we can also give you less notice than 14 days, but 15only if you agree to this. if you have a representative, you may want to discuss this matter with them as they may need to have 14 days notice of any hearing. this does not mean that we will only give you less than 14 days notice of the hearing, but it means that we can do if an earlier date is available. if you agree to receiving less than 14 days notice of your hearing, please tick the yes box here, otherwise tick no. if you have ticked yes, please make sure that you have provided your phone number in section 1 as we will need to telephone you to arrange a short notice hearing. section 8 your signature this section is for your signature. it is a legal requirement for your appeal to be signed. please sign your name here, write your name in block capitals in the box underneath and record the date that you signed the form in the box provided. if you do not sign your appeal form, hmcts may have to return the appeal to you for you to sign it. if you have named a representative at section 4, signing the appeal form will also give hmcts your permission to correspond with them and discuss your appeal with them should the need arise. what to do now where to send your appeal this section tells you where to send your appeal. where you send your appeal depends on where you live. there are two addresses to send your appeal to and these are shown on the appeal form. if you

sscs5a-eng.txt,"3. making your appeal the lawthe law has certain rules about appeals and hmcts can only accept your appeal if it meets these legal criteria. your appeal must: be made in writing; be in english or welsh; include with it a copy of the mandatory reconsideration notice; give reasons for the appeal; and, be signed by you, unless you have appointed someone else to act on your behalf. if your appeal does not meet all these criteria hmcts may have to return it to you and may not be able to consider your appeal at all unless you provide these details. because of the legal requirement to include specic information hmcts strongly recommend that you use an appeal form to make your appeal. the form helps you gather the right information in a step-by-step way and has a checklist you can use to make sure that everything is included. details of where you may obtain this are provided overleaf and on the justice website. 7the form also asks you questions about what type of hearing you would like, dates you would like us to avoid and whether you have any special needs. if you prefer, you can still make your appeal just by writing a letter, but you risk missing out some of the information the law requires. also, hmcts may have to write out to you separately to ask about your hearing requirements and availability and this creates a delay in the process. if you want to appeal by writing your own letter, use the appeal form as your guide and include in your letter all the things that the appeal form asks for. time-limitsfor tax credits, child benet and guardians allowance appeals you have one calendar month from the date when the mandatory reconsideration notice was sent to you in which to appeal. your appeal is not regarded as made, until it has been received by hmcts. for example, if the letter giving the decision is sent to you on 15 march, your appeal must arrive in hmcts by 15 april at the latest. if you nd yourself outside the time-limit, you must give reasons why the appeal is late. if you do not provide reasons your appeal may be returned to you. there is a special section on the appeal form where you can give reasons for lateness. please remember, if the time limit is very soon your appeal may be late by the time it arrives in hmcts, even if it is not late on the day you post it. if hmrc do not object to the reasons for your appeal being late it will generally proceed as though it was received in time. we will write to you if hmrc object to your appeal being late. the appeal form hmcts strongly recommend that you use the sscs5 appeal form to make your appeal. the form will help you record the type of information you require in a simple step-by-step process. you can obtain the form: rom the website www.justice.gov.uk; or, rom the gov.uk website at www.gov.uk; or, isiting local independent advice agencies who may stock the form. if you need advice on completing the appeal form you may call hmcts on 0300 123 1142 if you live in england or wales or 0141 354 8400 if you live in scotland. in the next section instructions are provided on how to complete form sscs5.

to be kept condential normally there are only two parties to the appeal, you and hmrc. clearly hmrc will know all about you. however sometimes the dispute you have with hmrc may involve another person. for example both parents (or another adult) may be claiming child benet. in such cases that other person might be joined as a party to the appeal. as that other party has a right to see all the evidence submitted as part of the appeal there will be occasions when certain types of evidence, such as bills or bank statements, are received which will include your home address. the other party to the appeal will have the right to see this evidence. if, however, you do not want the other party to know your current address (and they do not already know it), you can ask for your address to be kept condential. if you do this, any piece of evidence received relating to you will be scrutinised by hmcts staff and will be edited to remove all address details before it is circulated. use

sscs6a-eng.txt,"73. making your appeal the law in law there are certain rules about appeals and hm courts & tribunals service can only accept your appeal if it meets these legal criteria. your appeal must: be made in writing; be in english or welsh; include with it a copy of the outcome of review notice; give reasons for the appeal; and, be signed by the applicant to the dmps or their personal representative. if your appeal does not meet all these criteria, hm courts & tribunals service may have to return it to you and may not be able to consider your appeal at all unless you provide these details. because of the requirement to include specic information, hm courts & tribunals service strongly recommend that you use an appeal form to make your appeal. the form helps you gather the right information in a step-by-step way and has a checklist you can use to make sure that everything is included. details of where you may obtain this are provided overleaf and on the justice website. the form also asks you questions about what type of hearing you would like, dates you would like hm courts & tribunals service to avoid and whether you have any special needs. if you prefer, you can still make your appeal just by writing a letter, but you risk missing out some of the information the law requires. also, hm courts & tribunals service may have to write out to you separately to ask about your hearing requirements and availability and this creates a delay in the process. if you want to appeal by writing your own letter, use the appeal form as your guide and include in your letter all the things that it asks for. time-limits for dmps appeals, you have one calendar month from the date when the outcome of review notice from the dmps scheme administrator was sent to you in which to appeal. your appeal is not regarded as made until it has been received by hm courts & tribunals service. for example, if the outcome of review notice is sent to you on 15 march, your appeal must arrive in hm courts & tribunals service by 15 april at the latest. if you nd yourself outside the time-limit, you must give reasons why the appeal is late. if you do not provide reasons your appeal may be returned to you. there is a special section on the appeal form where you can give reasons for lateness. please remember, if the time limit is very soon your appeal may be late by the time it arrives in hm courts & tribunals service, even if it is not late on the day you post it. 8 if the dmps scheme administrator does not object to the reasons for your appeal being late, the appeal will generally proceed as though it was received in time. we will write to you if the dmps scheme administrator objects to your appeal being late. the appeal form hm courts & tribunals service strongly recommend that you use an appeal form to make your appeal. the form will help record the type of information required in a simple step- by-step process. the form to be used for people making an appeal about decisions by the scheme administrator for the diffuse mesothelioma payment scheme is sscs6 .you can obtain forms: from the website www.justice.gov.uk; or, from the website www.gov.uk; or, by contacting the scheme administrator on 0131 331 9090. if you need advice on completing the appeal form you may call hm courts & tribunals service on 0300 123 1142 if you live in england or wales, or 0141 354 8400 if you live in scotland. in the next section instructions are provided on how to complete form sscs6.

sscs6a-eng.txt,"the second part of section 5 asks you to conrm whether your appeal is in time. the earlier section in this booklet, time limits (see page 5) , tells you more about how these are worked out and you may want to refer back to this to check the details. your appeal will be considered late if it is received by hm courts & tribunals service more than one calendar month after the date on the outcome of review notice. if your appeal is late, or if it will be late by the time hm courts & tribunals service receive it, you must provide reasons why it is late. if your appeal is received late and no reasons are provided, hm courts & tribunals service will return the appeal to you. use this section to record reasons for lateness if this applies. you do not need to complete this section in block capitals. however, an appeal received late with reasons for lateness provided will be treated by hm courts & tribunals service as being received in time, unless the dmps scheme administrator raises an objection to it. if an objection is received, we may send a copy of it to you and may invite you to comment on it before referring it to a judge. the judge will review your case and decide if there is any merit in the arguments. 14 section 6 about your choice of hearing this section is all about how you would like the tribunal to make a decision on your appeal. normally, hm courts & tribunals service will arrange a hearing for your appeal and you or your representative will be expected to attend. hm courts & tribunals service call this having an oral hearing. at an oral hearing, you, and your representative, if you have one, will be given the opportunity to and put forward your case in person to the tribunal and to answer any questions they may have. the dmps scheme administrator also has the right to attend the oral hearing and put forward their case. the tribunal can also direct which type of hearing takes place. the alternative to an oral hearing is having your case decided by the tribunal on the papers provided to them. neither you nor the dmps scheme administrator will attend and the tribunal will come to its decision on the basis of what is in the appeal papers. the tribunal will consider your letter of appeal, any supporting evidence you have provided and the dmps scheme administrators response to your appeal. hm courts & tribunals service refer to this as a paper hearing. a paper hearing will take place if all parties agree to it and no-one has asked for an oral hearing. the dmps scheme administrator is also given the opportunity to express their preference for the type of hearing they would like. the tribunal can also direct what type of hearing takes place. an oral hearing will only be arranged if: you ask for an oral hearing; or, the dmps scheme administrator asks for an oral hearing; or, the tribunal itself decides that an oral hearing would be more appropriate than deciding the case on the papers. if you change your mind after returning the notice of appeal form (form sscs6) and want to switch from having your case decided on the papers to having an oral hearing, or vice- versa, please tell hm courts & tribunals service as soon as possible. as long as you have not been given a hearing date, you can do this by phone. if you have received a hearing date, however, you will need to put this in writing. it is too late to change after the tribunal has made its decision on your appeal. one thing you are likely to want to know, when deciding whether to choose a hearing or not, is where your appeal hearing would take place. hm courts & tribunals service holds appeal hearings at a national network of over 100 locations throughout england, scotland and wales. there is a tribunal venue in most cities and towns. hm courts & tribunals service will try to arrange for your hearing to take place at the venue that is nearest to you. please contact us in writing if the venue we offer you would not be convenient. a list of all venues is available on our website www.justice.gov.uk . 15if you would prefer a hearing but you would be unable to travel to the tribunal venue, because you are so severely disabled that you are housebound, you can request what is called an out-of-centre hearing. this would involve the exceptional step of the tribunal hearing your appeal at your home or at an alternative location. a request for an out-of- centre hearing should be supported by a letter from your doctor conrming that you are unable to travel at all, even by taxi. virtually all our tribunal venues have access for people with disabilities. if you would like conrmation that the venue you will be using is suitable to your own individual needs, you will have the opportunity to indicate your requirements in section 7 of the appeal form. once you have decided what type of hearing you want, tick the box to make your choice on the form. there are two choices: i want to attend a hearing of my appeal or i want my appeal decided on the papers tick one of the boxes to make your choice. if you have ticked the box to say that you want to attend a hearing, you should move on to section 7. if you ticked the box to say that you want your appeal decided on the papers, you can skip section 7 completely and go straight to section 8. 16 section 7 oral hearings your needs and requirements this section is all about your needs and requirements for an oral hearing. if you do not want an oral hearing, you should skip this section. if you need to write in any of the boxes in this section you do not need to use block capitals. question 1 your availability because you want to be present at the hearing, you should write down here any dates or times you would be unavailable for a hearing. this might be a regular date when you are unavailable, for example, every thursday because of domestic or other commitments, or you might be aware of specic dates you will be unavailable, such as hospital appointments or booked holidays. you should consider unavailability for 6 months ahead. remember, you can always tell hm courts & tribunals service of any changes to your availability by telephoning or writing to us. question 2 your needs we need to make sure your hearing takes place in a location which is suitable for you and that you can access easily. please tell us in this section about any particular needs you may have. this might be something like a hearing loop or special requirements because of a disability or mobility issue. question 3 your signer/interpreter and language requirements please let us know here whether you require an interpreter to assist you at the hearing. like the courts, tribunals insist on using independent, professional interpreters and signers. relying on a friend or relative is not acceptable. your interpreter could be a person who interprets verbally to translate english into another language or this could be a sign interpreter who translates spoken words into british sign language. if you tick yes in this section you must also record the language and dialect you require. when hm courts & tribunals service arrange your hearing, we will ensure that an interpreter is provided who meets your needs. question 4 your notice of hearing the law requires hm courts & tribunals service to give you a minimum of 14 days notice of your hearing. this gives you enough time to prepare for your hearing, but it also prevents hm courts & tribunals service from offering you a hearing date which becomes available at short notice because of, for example, a cancellation. if you prefer, we can also give you less notice than 14 days, but only if you agree to this. if you have a representative, you may want to discuss this matter with them as they may need to have 14 days notice of any hearing. this does not mean that we will only give you less than 14 days notice of the hearing, but it means that we can do if an earlier date is available. 17if you agree to receiving less than 14 days notice of your hearing, please tick the yes box here, otherwise tick no. if you have ticked yes, please make sure that you have provided your phone number in section 1 as we will need to telephone you to arrange a short notice hearing. 18 section 8 signing the appeal form this section is about the signature for the appeal form. an appeal form must be signed for it to be valid. this is a legal requirement. please sign your name here, write your name in block capitals in the box underneath and record the date that you signed the form in the box

document called guide to telephone case management hearings which gives full details of what to call the judge and the sorts of things that will be discussed. it is important that both parties discuss the case before the telephone hearing if possible.at the hearing the judge will set a timetable to ensure that the main hearing runs smoothly and that the panel hearing the case have all the evidence they need to make a decision and enough time to hear the case.page 6on occasions, a case may need more than one telephone hearing.requests by the partiesit is also possible to refer an issue to a judge by sending in a written request. you may want to ask for extra time to file a statement or to ask for the hearing to be postponed. if you make such an application it is important to say what you want and why you want it. you should also send a copy of the application to the other party so that they can give the judge their views as well. if you want to request a change to a date it may be helpful to suggest alternative dates.the tribunal can: allow you or the other party to amend any document you provide in relation to the proceedings give you extra time to file a document or statement adjourn or postpone a hearing stay proceedings (which means proceedings are put on hold). withholding documents or informationthe tribunal can prohibit the disclosure of any document or information to you or someone else if satisfied that disclosure would identify someone it considers should not be identified or if disclosure would be likely to cause serious harm. withholding documents or evidence is exceptional. in most cases both parties will be entitled to see all the documents in the case.summoning of witnesses and the production of documentsthe tribunal can issue a summons requiring someone to attend an oral hearing or make an order requiring the production of certain documents. if you want the tribunal to issue a summons you should raise the issue with the judge at a telephone hearing or make a written application. you will need to explain why you think the summons is necessary. the tribunal does not make a summons unless the person you want to appear has said they will not attend. people summoned must have 14 days notice of the hearing and may object to it. you may also be asked by the witness to pay his or her expenses to attend the hearing and you will have to meet this cost. if you apply for a summons the tribunal will need full contact details for the witness.if the other party or someone else a third party has documents which you think are relevant to the case you can ask the judge to order them to supply the documents to you.the respondent to the case must disclose all relevant documents and evidence to you, even if it supports your case. if you think they have not supplied you with all the relevant documents raise the issue with the judge, explaining what you think they havent sent to you and why it is relevant, either at a telephone hearing or in writing. do not wait until page 7just before the main hearing to ask the judge ill not want to delay the case unless it is absolutely necessary. if the documents or evidence are held by a third party you can make an application to the judge. you will need to say exactly what you want them to disclose and give reasons why you think the evidence is relevant. you will also need full contact details for the third party. if the judge makes the order s/he will give the third party a chance to say why they should not disclose the documents or evidence. again, it is important to make an application for disclosure as early as possible.the hearingappeals heard togetherthe tribunal can deal with and hear two or more appeals together if they relate to the same person/ provider or if they raise common issues. this is sometimes referred to as consolidation, and will be discussed at the telephone case management hearing if it is relevant.oral hearing or paper determinationthe tribunal will hold an oral hearing to determine your appeal. however, the matter can be determined on the papers alone if you and the respondent consent and if the tribunal agrees. nearly all cases are held with the parties attending. emergency cases may be suitable for a paper hearing but in all cases where a factual dispute needs to be resolved, the tribunal will list the case for an oral hearing which the parties attend.at an oral hearing the panel may hear evidence from witnesses or may just hear from the parties this is sometimes referred to as a case conducted on submissions.the respondent will usually have a legal representative. this does not put them at an advantage. the judge and panel members are very used to dealing with self representing litigants (unrepresented people) and they will explain the procedure to you and make sure you have the opportunity to present your case.where an oral hearing is held it is in your interests to attend. if you fail to do so the tribunal can proceed without you. if this happens you wont have the opportunity to put your case or ask questions of the respondent as the hearing progresses.oral hearings are held in public except where the tribunal directs otherwise. the tribunal can also exclude persons from the hearing or part of the hearing if it has concerns that their attendance may have an adverse impact on the hearingrepresentation at the hearingyou can be represented at the hearing by anyone you choose, whether a lawyer or not. let both the tribunal and the other party know if you will be represented and if so, the name of your representative.page 8services of an interpreter or signerif you need an interpreter or signer at the hearing, please let us know as soon as possible. we will arrange for one to be at the hearing. preparation for the hearingthe decision-making party will usually be asked to prepare a bundle of papers for the hearing. the bundle will include all the documents you and the other party wish the appeal panel to consider. the respondent will send you your copy of the bundle. we will send you a guide to statements and bundles which sets out how to make a statement and what goes into the bundle.arranging the date(s) and venuethe judge will set a date and time for the hearing at the telephone case management hearing. the venue will be confirmed at a later date. we try to ensure that the hearing is in your local area, and certainly within 2 hours travelling distance.in emergency cases the hearing will be listed very quickly so you will only have about 3 days notice of where it will take place.if the case is in respect of a hearing to consider making an order under section 166(5) of the education act 2002 (registration of independent schools) you will get at least 7 days notice.in emergency cases the hearing will be listed very quickly so you will only have about 3 days notice of where it will take place.if the case is in respect of a hearing to consider making an order under section 166(5) of the education act 2002 (registration of independent schools) you will get at least 7 days notice.if you live within reasonable travelling distance of central london, hearings will usually take place at 18 pocock street se1 0bw, which is close to southwark tube station. otherwise, we will arrange a venue nearer to your home or business address. if you live in wales, your hearing will normally take place in cardiff or a suitable location elsewhere in wales giving evidence you will be given the opportunity to put your case to the tribunal and may call any adult to give evidence on your behalf, although the judge has the power to restrict the number of witnesses. the tribunal can also require either party to provide expert evidence. children and vulnerable adults may only appear as witnesses in person if the tribunal considers it necessary to enable a fair hearing. in such cases the tribunal may appoint a page 9person with appropriate skills or experience in facilitating the giving of evidence by children and vulnerable adults and may require the evidence to be given by telephone or video link.when all the evidence has been heard, you and the respondent will have a chance to make closing remarks to the panel. this is an opportunity to highlight what you see as the important points in your case but you cannot introduce anything new at this stage. the panel will then retire to consider its decision. the panel will not give you a decision on the day. the decision and reasons will be sent to you and the respondent in writing within 3 working days for emergency cases and within 10 working days for non emergency cases.the decisionthe decision does not have to be unanimous. where the three members of the appeal panel can not agree the majority view will prevail. the panel do not normally tell the parties whether the decision is unanimous or by majority unless they give reasons for the different views. the appeal panel will either uphold your appeal or direct that the appeal be dismissed. in some cases the panel may be minded to allow the appeal but impose conditions. this only applies to cases involving registration with a regulatory body. for example, the panel may disagree with the regulatory body about cancellation of registration but impose certain registration conditions of its own.the tribunal can dispose of an appeal by way of a consent order. such orders can only be made at the request of both parties if they are in agreement and only if it considers it appropriate.written decision made public reporting restrictions all care standards decisions are made public on our website, except to the extent that it is necessary to hold any details back to comply with a restricted reporting order. the tribunal can make an order restricting the publication of names to prevent you or a child or vulnerable adult or any other person at the hearing being identified. if you want a restricted reporting order, you should raise it at the telephone hearing, send your request to the tribunal setting out your reasons or raise it with the panel. the full care standards decisions are published on the care standards website application to set aside the decisionyou can ask the tribunal to set aside the decision if: a relevant document in your case was not received in time to be considered by the appeal panel you or your representative was not present at the hearing, or you think there was some irregularity in the proceedings. if you want to ask for the decision to be set aside, you must do so in writing within 28 days of receiving the decision. forms for the purpose are available on our website.page 10application to appeal the tribunals decision you can appeal some preliminary decisions (other than case management decisions) and final decisions of the tribunal to the upper tribunal. however, you must first apply to this tribunal asking for permission to appeal. you will not be granted permission to appeal simply on the basis that you dont agree with the decision. you must be able to show that the panel have made an error of law, and demonstrate what that error is.on receipt of an appeal application, the judge will first consider whether to review the decision based on your reasons for appeal. a fresh decision may be issued following a review, or if the tribunal grants you permission to appeal, your appeal will be forwarded to the upper tribunal to consider. if the tribunal decides that a review is not appropriate and if it refuses your application to appeal, you can make an application for permission to appeal direct to the upper tribunal. to do this you should contact: upper tribunal (administrative appeals chamber rolls building) 5th floor 7 rolls buildings

appeals process, but in most cases you need the tribunals consent for the case to be withdrawn. you need consent because there may be instances where the tribunal think it would be in the interests of justice that the case is heard. if you want to withdraw, write to the tribunal explaining your reasons. you need to be aware that in withdrawing your case, the other party may apply for costs against you. please see under costs below. applications for costs are rare and are only page 11 successful if your conduct has been unreasonable. the earlier you withdraw an appeal the less likely an order for costs will be. the tribunal will always ask your views and your ability to pay before making an order for costs.once you withdraw your appeal, you can have your case re-instated with the consent of the tribunal. if you want your appeal re-instated you have to apply to the tribunal within 28 days of the notice of withdrawal or, if you withdraw at the hearing, within 28 days of the date of the hearing.the decision making body may also withdraw from the appeal at any time and if this happens you may be able to ask the tribunal to award you costs if you think they have acted unreasonably. striking out an appealthe tribunal can strike out your appeal or part of your case if you fail to comply with a direction or fail to co-operate to such an extent that the tribunal panel can not conduct the proceedings fairly or justly. exceptionally, an appeal can also be struck out by the tribunal if it thinks you have no reasonable prospect of success in your appeal or part of it. however, you will be given the opportunity to make representations before the appeal is struck out and you can ask for your appeal to be reinstated. any such application must be made in writing within 28 days of the date notifying you of the strike out.costs paying the other parties costs in some circumstances the tribunal can order you to pay all or some of the expenses incurred by the other party in responding to your appeal. but a costs order will only be made if the tribunal considers you have acted unreasonably in your conduct of the appeal. in considering if costs should be awarded, your financial circumstances will be taken in to account and you will be given the opportunity to make representations. costs can also be awarded to you by the other party for the same reasons. you must make an application within 14 days of receipt of a notice of withdrawal where no consent is needed, or from the date of decision or consent given for a withdrawal where consent is required.the tribunal does not award costs simply because you have lost your case.expensesthe tribunal does not reimburse travel expenses or loss of earnings incurred by parties and their witnesses to attend hearings. further information if you have any queries about the contents of this booklet or are unsure how to proceed with your appeal, you should contact the care standards office. page

the tribunal please quote the tribunals reference number in the subject line of your email. the reference will be assigned by the tribunal to one of the following procedures. simplied procedure this procedure is for the speedy and economical determination of cases in which there is no substantial issue of law or valuation practice and no substantial conict of fact is likely to arise. it is often suitable where the amount at stake is small. the appeal goes to a hearing as quickly as possible and with the minimum of formality. in most cases a date for the hearing, normally about three months ahead, will be xed immediately. the parties may be required to le statements of case. not later than one month before the hearing, the parties must exchange copies of all other documents, such as witness statements, on which they intend to rely. if an experts report is relied on it must be exchanged not later than 14 days before the hearing. the hearing is informal and will almost always be completed in a single day. a lawyer need not be instructed and a surveyor or other professional may act as both advocate and as expert witness or you may choose to represent yourself. except in compensation cases, to which particular statutory provisions on costs apply, an award of costs will be made only in exceptional circumstances. the usual tribunal fees, such as the hearing fee, are payable. written representations procedure the tribunal may order that the proceedings be determined without an oral hearing. an order will only be made if the tribunal, having considered the issues in the case and desirability of minimising costs, decides that oral evidence and argument can properly be dispensed with. directions will be given to the parties for the ling of representations and documents. if necessary, the tribunal will carry out a site inspection before giving a written decision. special procedure the special procedure is for cases requiring case management by a judge or member in view of their complexity, the amount in issue or wider importance. an early case-management hearing will be held for appropriate directions to be given. where appropriate a date for the nal hearing will be xed at the case-management hearing and the steps which the parties are required to take, and any further case-management hearings will be timetabled by reference to this date. a high level of co-operation with the tribunal and between themselves is expected of parties using the special procedure. each party should consider whether to apply for the determination of a preliminary issue, for permission to call additional expert witnesses, or for any other order. the parties may agree the terms of any order that they wish the tribunal to make and should seek to reduce areas of disagreement. not less than seven days before a case-management hearing the parties must le an agreed position statement summarising the subject-matter of the case and to the extent that it is possible to do so at that stage, the issues. they must also state the areas of expertise of each witness that they propose to rely on and the general scope of their evidence. standard procedure the standard procedure is used where a hearing is necessary and the issues of fact, law or valuation are too complex for the simplied procedure but not so complex or of general importance as to require the special procedure. under the standard procedure case management is in the hands of the registrar who will give such directions as appear to be necessary. directions given may, as appropriate, use elements of the special procedure (for example, timetabling through to the hearing date) or the simplied procedure. a registrar will hold a case-management hearing should it appear appropriate to do so. co-operation between the parties is expected and they should agree appropriate directions for the conduct of the proceedings and make an application to the registrar for those directions by

owchart for references, which may be viewed online at our website or requested from the lands chamber oce. the tribunal fees, such as the hearing fee, are payable in all cases. you may apply for a change in procedure during the course of proceedings by setting out your reasons, conrming that you have given notice to all other parties and paying the 110 fee for an interlocutory application. at any time a registrar or the judge or member to whom the case has been allocated, may direct that it should be assigned to one of the other procedures. all submissions from the parties will be taken into account in deciding which procedure should apply. simplied procedure in certain small, simple or straightforward cases, time and costs may be saved by use of the simplied procedure. this procedure is for the speedy and economical determination of cases in which there is no substantial issue of law or valuation practice and no substantial conict of fact is likely to arise. it is often suitable where the amount at stake is small. the appeal goes to a hearing as quickly as possible and with the minimum of formality and cost. the consent of the claimant, appellant or applicant will usually be required before a case is allocated to the simplied procedure. in most cases a date for the hearing, normally about three months ahead, will be xed immediately. the parties may be required to le statements of case. not later than one month before the hearing, the parties must exchange copies of all other documents, such as witness statements, on which they intend to rely except their experts report, if any, which must be exchanged not later than 14 days before the hearing. the hearing is informal and strict rules of evidence do not apply. it will almost always be completed in a single day. a surveyor may act both as advocate and as expert witness. except in compensation cases, to which particular statutory provisions on costs apply, an award of costs is made only in exceptional circumstances. the usual tribunal fees, such as the hearing fee, are payable. written representations procedure the tribunal may order that the proceedings be determined without an oral hearing but will not usually do so without the consent of the parties to the proceedings. an order will only be made if the tribunal, having considered the issues in the case and the desirability of minimising costs, decides that oral evidence and argument can properly be dispensed with. directions will be given to the parties for the ling of representations and documents. if necessary, the judge or member allocated to the case will seek to carry out a site inspection before giving a written decision. special procedure the special procedure is for cases requiring case management by a judge or member in view of their complexity, the amount in issue or wider importance. under the special procedure an early case-management hearing is held for appropriate directions to be given for the fair, expeditious and economical conduct of the proceedings. where appropriate a date for the nal hearing is xed at the case-management hearing and the steps which the parties are required to take, and any further case-management hearings, are timetabled by reference to this date. each party needs to consider whether it is appropriate to make application for the determination of a preliminary issue and for permission to call more than the permitted number of expert witnesses and identify, and where necessary make application for, any other order that it wishes the tribunal to make at the case-management hearing. the parties must seek to agree the terms of any order that they wish the tribunal to make. not less than seven days before a case- management hearing the parties must le an agreed position statement summarising the subject-matter of the case and, to the extent that it is possible to do so at that stage, the issues. they must also state the areas of expertise of each expert witness that they propose to rely on and the general scope of their evidence. standard procedure the standard procedure is used in cases where a hearing is necessary and the issues of fact, law or valuation are too complex for the simplied procedure but not so complex or of general importance so as to require the special procedure. under the standard procedure case management is in the hands of the registrars who will give such directions as appear to be necessary. directions given may, as appropriate, use elements of the special procedure (for example, timetabling through to the hearing date) or the simplied procedure. a registrar will hold a case-management hearing should it appear appropriate to do so. if they wish to do so the parties may seek to agree appropriate directions for the conduct of the proceedings and may make an application to the registrar for those directions by consent or on notice. the interlocutory application fee is payable. 5all cases interlocutory applications if you are unable to comply with a direction that has been given during the course of proceedings, seek a direction, or wish to call more than one expert witness (see rule 17), you must make an application promptly for a stay of proceedings, for an extension of time or for the direction(s) sought. see rule 6 for full details of the interlocutory application procedure. you should seek the prior agreement of the other parties and, if it is not given, tell them that any objection must be made in writing to the tribunal within 10 days. in the application you must set out your reasons , conrm that you have given notice of the application and objection procedure to all other parties. remember to enclose the fee that is set out in the tribunals fees order, which may be viewed on line. it is 110. please note that all cheques must be made payable to hm courts & tribunals service. adr/mediation the tribunal supports the resolution of disputes by consent by the parties.

if you wish to email the tribunal please quote the tribunal's reference number in the subject line of your email. the appeal will be assigned by the tribunal to one of the following procedures simplied procedure this procedure is for the speedy and economical determination of cases in which there is no substantial issue of law or valuation practice and no substantial conict of fact is likely to arise. it is often suitable where the amount at stake is small. the appeal goes to a hearing as quickly as possible and with the minimum of formality. in most cases a date for the hearing, normally about three months ahead, will be xed immediately. the parties may be required to le statements of case. not later than one month before the hearing, the parties must exchange copies of all other documents, such as witness statements, on which they intend to rely. if an experts report is relied on it must be exchanged not later than 14 days before the hearing. the hearing is informal and will almost always be completed in a single day. a lawyer need not be instructed and a surveyor or other professional may act as both advocate and as expert witness or you may choose to represent yourself. except in compensation cases, to which particular statutory provisions on costs apply, an award of costs will be made only in exceptional circumstances. the usual tribunal fees, such as the hearing fee, are payable. written representations procedure the tribunal may order that the proceedings be determined without an oral hearing. an order will only be made if the tribunal, having considered the issues in the case and desirability of minimising costs, decides that oral evidence and argument can properly be dispensed with. directions will be given to the parties for the ling of representations and documents. if necessary, the tribunal will carry out a site inspection before giving a written decision. special procedure the special procedure is for cases requiring case management by a judge or member in view of their complexity, the amount in issue or wider importance. an early case-management hearing will be held for appropriate directions to be given. where appropriate a date for the nal hearing will be xed at the case-management hearing and the steps which the parties are required to take, and any further case-management hearings will be timetabled by reference to this date. a high level of co-operation with the tribunal and between themselves is expected of parties using the special procedure. each party should consider whether to apply for the determination of a preliminary issue, for permission to call additional expert witnesses, or for any other order. the parties may agree the terms of any order that they wish the tribunal to make and should seek to reduce areas of disagreement. not less than seven days before a case-management hearing the parties must le an agreed position statement summarising the subject-matter of the case and to the extent that it is possible to do so at that stage, the issues. they must also state the areas of expertise of each witness that they propose to rely on and the general scope of their evidence. standard procedure the standard procedure is used where a hearing is necessary and the issues of fact, law or valuation are too complex for the simplied procedure but not so complex or of general importance as to require the special procedure. under the standard procedure case management is in the hands of the registrar who will give such directions as appear to be necessary. directions given may, as appropriate, use elements of the special procedure (for example, timetabling through to the hearing date) or the simplied procedure. a registrar will hold a case-management hearing should it appear appropriate to do so. co-operation between the parties is expected and they should agree appropriate directions for the conduct of the proceedings and make an application to the registrar for those directions by consent or on notice. 7all cases compliance with directions parties are expected to comply with a direction that has been given during the course of proceedings and non- compliance

partnership can apply for a full grc. in addition following the implementation of the marriage (same sex couples) act 2013 and the marriage and civil partnership (scotland) act 2014, many applicants who are married or in a civil partnership are now able to apply for their gender recognition without ending their marriage or civil partnership. your eligibility will depend on where your marriage or civil partnership was registered and may also depend on whether your spouse consents to remaining in the marriage following your gender recognition. this is explained in greater depth below. all applicants who are married or in a civil partnership and who wish to end their relationship can still choose to apply for an interim grc which they can use to annul or dissolve their existing legal relationship. marriages and civil partnerships registered in england and wales the laws on marriage and civil partnership in england and wales were changed by the marriage (same sex couples) act 2013, to enable marriages of same sex couples to take place from march 2014. the 2013 act also changed some parts of the gender recognition act 2004. the laws in england and wales are now different from those in scotland and northern ireland. if you are married under the law of england and wales or under the law of a country or territory outside the uk, then your marriage is considered to be a protected marriage. applicants who are in a protected marriage can choose to apply for a full grc. for this both the applicant and their spouse will each need to complete a statutory declaration conrming their wish to remain married post gender recognition. if a spouse decides not to issue a statutory declaration or withdraws it before the application is dealt with, then the panel will instead issue an interim grc, which can be used by the applicant (or their spouse) to end the marriage following which a full grc will be issued. if your civil partnership is under the law of england and wales it will be treated as a protected civil partnership. people in protected civil partnerships can chose to convert their page 10 partnership to a marriage. if you are in a protected civil partnership and want to apply for gender recognition, then you will need to decide whether you and your partner want to convert your civil partnership to a marriage. if you decide that you wish to convert your civil partnership to a marriage, this should be done before any application for gender recognition. this is the simplest way of proceeding. where an applicant in a civil partnership applies to the panel for gender recognition the panel will issue an interim grc. this is because in england and wales, like the rest of the uk, a civil partnership may only be registered between people of the same sex in law. so before a full grc could be granted it would be necessary for the applicant to end their civil partnership. however, it is possible for both civil partners in a protected civil partnership to apply for legal recognition at the same time. where the panel grants both partners a full grc it will do so on the same day which enables them to remain in their civil partnership. where both civil partners want to apply for gender recognition they should make their applications at the same time and make sure that the grp administrative team are aware that their applications are linked. marriages and civil partnerships registered in scotland the marriage and civil partnership (scotland) act 2014 received royal assent on 12 march 2014 enabling the rst marriages of same sex couples to take place from december 2014. if your marriage was solemnised in scotland then you are considered to be in a scottish protected marriage. you can apply to the panel for a full grc, providing your spouse also completes a statutory declaration conrming they too wish to remain in your marriage following your gender recognition. if you are married but you and/or your spouse do not wish to remain married, following your gender recognition then the grp will issue an interim grc, which you can use in court proceedings to end your marriage. it is also possible for applicants in a scottish protected marriage with an interim grc to apply to the sheriff court for their full grc, without rst ending their marriage, irrespective of whether the couple wish to remain together post gender recognition. if your civil partnership is registered in scotland it will be treated as a scottish protected civil partnership. people in scottish protected civil partnerships can choose to change their partnership to a marriage either by an administrative process or by a marriage ceremony. if you are in a scottish protected civil partnership and want to apply for gender recognition, then you will need to decide whether you and your partner want to change your civil partnership to a marriage. (it is not possible for one partner to apply for gender recognition and for that civil partnership to continue following gender recognition.) if you decide that you wish to change your civil partnership to a marriage, this should be done before any application for gender recognition. this is the simplest way of proceeding. if you are in a civil partnership and apply to the panel for gender recognition the panel will issue an interim grc. this is because in scotland, like the rest of the uk, a civil partnership may only be registered between people of the same sex in law. so before a full grc could be page 11 granted it would be necessary for the applicant to end their civil partnership. however, it is possible for both civil partners in a protected civil partnership to apply for legal recognition at the same time. where the panel grants both partners a full grc it will do so on the same day which enables them to remain in their civil partnership. where both civil partners want to apply for gender recognition they should make their applications at the same time and ensure that the grp administrative team are aware that their applications are linked. marriages and civil partnerships registered in northern ireland there are no plans to introduce the marriage of same sex couples into northern ireland. therefore those married under the law of northern ireland must be unmarried and not in a civil partnership before they can receive a full grc. if you knowingly or unknowingly obtain a full grc whilst still married under the law of northern ireland, or while in a civil partnership, your grc would not be valid and your legal gender would continue to be your birth gender. some transsexual people are legally married in their birth gender under the law of northern ireland (although after the transsexual person transitions, the couple may present as being of the same gender). these marriages are valid under northern irish law because until the transsexual person receives legal recognition in their acquired gender, he or she remains in law of their birth gender. summary of information on marriage and civil partnerships the gender recognition process has been designed to make applications for legal recognition from married people and those in civil partnerships as straightforward as possible. where an applicant satises all the evidential criteria for legal recognition at section 4, they will be treated as follows: if the applicant is in a protected or a scottish protected marriage and their spouse has issued a statutory declaration of consent to remaining in the marriage following gender recognition, they will be issued with a full grc. if the applicant is in a protected or a scottish protected marriage but either does not wish to remain married after gender recognition or else their spouse has not issued a statutory declaration of consent to remain married following gender recognition then they will be issued with an interim grc. if the applicant is in a protected or a scottish protected civil partnership, their civil partner also applies for a grc and both partners are successful then they will both be issued with full grcs on the same day. if the applicant is not in a protected marriage because they are married under the law of northern ireland he or she will receive an interim grc. page 12 if the applicant is in a civil partnership (or a protected or a scottish protected civil partnership and only one partner has successfully applied for gender recognition) he or she will receive an interim grc. an interim grc is valid for a period of six months from the date on which it is issued. it may be used as evidence if either member of the couple chooses to end their marriage or civil partnership on the basis that an interim grc has been issued to a party to the marriage or civil partnership, following which the court will issue a full grc. in england, wales and northern ireland, a marriage may be annulled or the civil partnership dissolved on this ground. in scotland, a decree of divorce may be granted on this ground but there the 6 months limit does not apply. those applicants in a scottish protected marriage with an interim grc may also apply to the sheriff court for a full grc without rst ending their marriage, but this must be done within six months of the date of issue of the interim certicate. if you have an interim grc then you may apply to the panel for a full certicate if: you are in a protected or a scottish protected marriage and your spouse issues a statutory declaration of consent to remain in the marriage post gender recognition, within 6 months of the date of issue of the interim certicate; or you convert or change your protected or scottish protected civil partnership to a protected or scottish protected marriage. your application to convert or change must be made within 6 months of the date of issue of the interim certicate and you will be required to prove this. both you and your spouse will have to complete a statutory declaration of consent to remain in the marriage post gender recognition; or your spouse or partner dies within 6 months of the date of issue of the interim certicate and you have not remarried or entered a new civil partnership.

ange. the court did not specify in detail what kinds of gender reassignment measures were requi red. the marital status of the applicant is not relevant; an applicant does not have to be unmarried. upon request the applicant can obtain an amended bi rth certificate (usually requested only after the first name has been changed). upon request the applicant can also apply for a new marriage certificate, however wi th one restriction: only the first name can be changed the fields for sex (male/female) are headers and c an therefore not be changed. in addition, the applicant can apply for

recognition of a sex change. the amendments to the civil code were introduced by means of a federal law, la loi relative la transsexualit passed on 10 may 2007 (2007-05-10/55) and explained by a mini

stating: the applicant has an intimate, constant and irreversible conviction of belonging to the opposite sex. the applicant has undergone gender reassignm ent treatment to the extent considered medically possible and justified; the applicant is unable to conceive. a successful application will result in an entry in the register of births and an amendment in the margin of the birth certificate of the applicant. ho wever, the civil code prov ides specifically that the legal change of sex is effected only by the entry in the register of births. foreigners registered on the population regi ster can change their sex under the same conditions as belgian citizens; however, forei gners registered on the aliens register can only officially change their sex if they fulfil the require ments stated by the count ry of which they are a national. if provisions in their country of orig in do not allow a change of sex, the belgian procedure will apply (article 35 of t he code of private international law). it would appear that the applicants marital stat us is no bar to an application as same-sex marriages are legal in belgium following a law passed in january 2003. bulgaria

anssexual person be unmarried before being accepted for gender 4country or territory outline of recognition process change. if he/she is married, the court applies t he rules for divorce. once a

cassation (the british equivalent of the high court) in 1992. these provide that when an individual has undergone suitable medical treatment, no longer po ssesses all the charac teristics of their original sex and has taken on the appearance an d social behaviour of the other sex, the individual's civil status should henceforth corr espond to the sex of his/her appearance. legal recognition depends upon medically verified evi dence of a transsexual syndrome and treatment (hormone therapy and a surgical operation leading to an artificial change of appearance) modifying the physical appearance to the assume d sex. in practice, the requirements of the courts vary, notably when experts (medical, psychological, endocrinal) are called upon to prove the sex change. in may 2010 the french ministry of justice sent a circular to the judiciary, advising them that they may recognise a change of sex in an indivi duals civil status if the person has undergone hormone treatment to result in an irreversible ph ysical or physiological transformation, which, together with any plastic surgery the person may have had (e.g. breast enhancement or removal, or facial surgery), has

instance (a local court) in the town where the birth was originally registered. the judicial decision to alter an individual's sex and the change of name are recorded in the margin of the birth certificate. an official change of sex does not call into question previous sexual identity i.e. a previous marriage is not retrospectively annulled upon change of sex. this means a french couple can stay married alt hough the gender change can, in certain cases, give grounds for fault in a divorce. it is up to the couple to decide. the civil code refers. a transsexual person whose birth certificate has been modified may marry in their acquired gender (i.e. a person of the opposite sex). the i ndividual can obtain a certified copy of the amended birth register. foreign nationals may also apply. germany the relevant legislation is the transsexuellengesetz , the law on transsexuals of 10.09.1980 that entered into force on 1 january 1981. a court can decide that a person should belong to the opposite sex where the applicant: has lived for three years in the opposite gender; 9country or territory outline of recognition process is of age; feels, due to being transsexual, that they belong not to their sex as assigned at birth, but rather to the opposite sex. a note is made in the margin of the birth record and the civil status record is noted with details of the courts decision. if a new birth certificat e is issued following legal recognition, this will show only the acquired gender. full legal recognition is achieved for all purposes including marriage. an amendment to the law was passed on 17th july 2009, removing a previous requirement to be unmarried from the legislation. the result is that married couples may remain in their existing marriage. a constitutional court decision of 11 january 2011 ruled inapplicable further requirements contained in the legislation to hav e a) undergone surgical intervention and b) be sterile. the legislation is open to: german nationals stateless persons who have their main residence in germany persons with a right of asylum or refugees domicile in germany; and foreigners with an indefinite right of residen ce in germany, or foreigners with a renewable residence permit who live lawfully in germ any on a permanent basis, whose home state has no equivalent law. greece there is no legislation on gender change but transsexual people can change their name and identity papers following surgical intervention. ac cording to jurisprudence, this operation is required due to therapeutic needs (psychological

no legal provisions relating to marriage. iceland an individual who has undergone gender reassi gnment therapy can request a change of name and identity number in the national registry (o perated by the national statistical bureau of iceland). up to now all applicants except one have undergone surgery before legal gender change, but in future this will not be required. a diagnosis of transsexualism is required, made after at least 2-3 years of observation where the person is living in the role of the desired gender, has a name characteristic for that gender and has been undergoing hormonal therapy for at least 1 year. gender reassignment therapy must be approved by the directorate of health who is advised by the board of gender operations. a person must be medically insured in iceland to qualify for treatment. once the national statistical bureau of iceland agrees to change the name and identity number in the national registry, this enables the indivi dual to attain the legal standards of his/ her acquired gender. he/ she will get an identity card issued by the national statistical bureau of iceland. icelandic names are gender specific so when the name has been changed the gender identity has been changed too. it is not possible to amend a birth certificate to show the acquired gender but in iceland the id card and/ or driving licence is the most relevant document and is preferable everywhere as a form of ident ification. the process has no legal effect on a pre-existing marriage. italy the relevant legislation is the legge 164/1982 of 14.04.1982, rules concerning rectification of sexual attributes ( norme in materia di rettificazione di attribuzione di sesso ). the legislation provides for the correction of a persons sex on the records held by the registrars office on production of a final judicial decision which assign s that person a different sex as a result of the change of the sexual characteristics. the c ourt may ask for a medical opinion regarding the psycho-physical condition of the person and decide if gender reassignment surgery is necessary. the law does not clarify the nature or extent of the reas signment required for recognition. male to female reassignment is usually authorised only when the person has had 10country or territory outline of recognition process complex surgery including orchidectomy, penectomy and vaginoplasty. it appears that only in one case has a judge ordered a gender reassignment without any surgery. the female to male change is usually only authorised when the person has had surgery including mastectomy and hysterectomy. under article 5 of the legislation all civil stat us documents are altered to show only the new gender and name. under article 4 of the legislat ion the change of gender causes the dissolution of a marriage. japan in japan, legal recognition is given to a pers on who has a persistent conviction that he/she belongs to the opposite sex, and has a will to make him/herself physically and socially conform to the opposite sex. the law 111 of july 2003, which took effect on 16 july 2004, called the law concerning special cases in handling gender for people with gender identity disorder', was revised in june 2008. under the revised law, t he applicant is required to meet all the following conditions: a) be over 20 years of age; b) be unmarried; c) have no living child aged 19 years or younger- this revision took effect on 18 december 2008; d) have no gonads or have permanently lost gonadal function; e) have a part of the body which assumes the ex ternal genital features of the opposite sex; in accordance with law 111, a person can change gender in law by entering this on their ""koseki"" (a person's family registration held in to wn offices; this is the conclusive document in law in japan). the applicant must meet all the abov e five conditions. the applicant must submit a medical diagnosis from more than two doctors as evidence to a family court. the contents to be included in the diagnosis are laid down by the ministry of health, labour and welfare ordinance, and include the medical history of gender identity disorder, and the progress and results of treatment. the doctors must have t he necessary knowledge and experience to make an appropriate judgement, and should reach a consensus as to the diagnosis based on medical knowledge. if the court judges that the applicants gender should be changed, a secretary of the court entrusts the heads of the local government office where the applicant registered his/her permanent residence to state the gender in the applicants' family registration. liechtenstein for the recognition of gender change, the princi pality of liechtenstein requires a document testifying the new gender. if this cannot be pr oduced, a medical attestation is required, confirming that gender re assignment surgery has ta ken place, and that t here is no possibility of reproduction in the original/primary gender. furthermore, a gender change may not be reversed. subsequently, the new gender is c onfirmed by the court, and the new name and gender is recorded in the official registers. luxembourg there is no legislation; the criteria for gender recognition have been established by case law. the general principle is that an individuals civil status is immutable and cannot be altered simply because a person wishes to do so; ther efore any change must be exceptional. the court follows three main criteria. these are that there is a discrepancy, discovered at an earlier age, between the psychological experience of the person and their biological sex at birth, that the individual has the intimate conviction that he or sh e is the victim of nature and that there is a situation of necessity. the courts decision is ba sed on medical certificates but the evidence can change according to the facts of the case. a gender change approved by the court is transcribed into the official records of civil st atus. after the transcription of the courts decision into the records of civil status, the birth certificate is rectified by t he civil status officer to indicate the new sex of the person. the birth certificat e is conclusive in law of a person's sex in luxembourg. identity or travel documents (car te d'identit/ passeport) are based on the birth certificate, i.e. these documents can only denote the new sex following rectification of the birth certificate. malta the system for obtaining a modification to a bi rth certificate following gender reassignment surgery is based not on legislation but on two judgements of the constitutional court, which 11country or territory outline of recognition process resulted in changes to birth certificates followi ng surgical intervention. although there is no statute which governs gender recognition, ma ltese courts have recognised gender changes and allowed amendments to birth certificates. t he original birth register/certificate will be amended but is not accessible to the public. all circulated birth certificates will be issued as amended, showing the individuals new status, as will all other legal documents. the applicant must be unmarried. in 2008 the civil court held t hat the amendment in the margin of a birth certificate was made on the grou nds of protecting privacy and not to show a legal change of gender, therefore preventing marriage as a person of the acquired gender. however, no further legal restrictions appear to apply, other than the right to marry in the acquired gender.

technology w ill issue a certificate st ating that the person has changed sex. with this certificate it is possible to change all other official documents (passport, birth certificate, id card etc).

by the civil law. in 1978 the supreme court stated that in ex ceptional cases a court can correct a birth certificate by changing the sex designati on before correctional surgery of sexual organs, if the features of the new sex are predominant and irreversible. in order to begin the courts procedure a citizen should obtain a medical diagnosis confirming that he or she is transsexual or intersex

to show a medical diagnosis, for others a completed mastectomy is required. in most cases courts require a medical diagnosis and hormonal therapy. a trial takes place in a civ il court with parents as

care provision (amended), article 38 - conditions of psychiatric treatment, secti on 4: ""the procedure of medical treatment of transsexuals is defined by a regulation that w ill be issued by the ministry of health"". while slovakia is missing such a regulation, according to the slovak sexology association, the gender change approved by the sexology clinic is in reality a combination of reassignment surgery and a hormone therapy, following an assessment by a doctor- an expert in sexual psychology (which usually takes years). as the gender change surgeries are not done in slovakia, slovak patients usually undergo this treatment in prague. the czech clinic then issues a document that serves as a document required by the slovak authorities (register office). based on this document and a letter of applicat ion from the person undergoing the change, the appropriate register office makes a formal record into the register book where the birth of the person is recorded. the new entry must reco rd the gender change, birth number and if the applicant requests it, also a change of the name and the surname. the new birth number of the individual is provi ded by the registry of citizens (birth number registration unit) to the register office. name and surname change is regulated by law no.300/1993 on name and surname (some of its provisions have been amended by law

26 and 37 of the law no.154/1994 on regi ster offices (amended) in connection with a regulation no.302/1994 to the law on register o ffices (amended) of the interior ministry. following all the above mentioned changes in the register book, the relevant authority (the register office) issues the citizen a new birt h certificate with a new identity that is a prerequisite to obtaining a new id card from the relevant police department. although the id is generally most frequently used, a birth certificat e is often required for administrative purposes to complement the id and, in some cases; t he

all cases. forms can be obtained from www.gov.uk/housing-tribunals/apply-to-the-tribunal, or if you do not have access to a computer, you can ask a case ofcer to send you a form. some applications involve the payment of a fee. fees information is contained in our application forms. once an application is received, it will be checked by a case ofcer for completeness and the applicant will be sent an acknowledgement. a copy will be sent to the other party (the respondent) and any person whose name and address is known to the tribunal whom the tribunal considers is likely to be signicantly affected by the application. a copy may also be sent to any other person the tribunal considers appropriate. when many respondents are named by an applicant, the case ofcer might ask the applicant either to provide sufcient copies and stamped addressed envelopes for this purpose or to send the documents direct to those persons on behalf of the tribunal. upon receipt of an application, the tribunal assesses the urgency and complexity of the case. in urgent cases, such as where the health, safety and welfare of people may be of concern, a hearing can be listed within days. in relatively simple cases, the parties may request, or the tribunal may suggest, that the case can be dealt with by considering the written evidence and the parties written representations only (without the need for an oral hearing). this is referred to as a paper determination . however, any party who wishes also has the right to request a hearing. page 3 case preparation in cases where the issues are not clear, there may be an oral case management conference (cmc) which provides an opportunity for the parties to make concessions and narrow the issues between them. if a cmc is arranged, parties are encouraged to attend. the cmc is a good opportunity for parties to have their say about what directions (see below) should be given in the case and to ask questions about the procedure that should be followed by the parties. in cases where the issues can be readily identied, a tribunal chairman will issue written procedural directions requesting particular actions from one or both parties before the hearing. the procedural directions document will sometimes set out what the issues are and say when the parties need to send each other copies of documents. it will say whether there is to be an inspection of the property and may give an estimate of the length of the nal hearing. if a party or another person is going to say something to the tribunal, he or she may be required to prepare a witness statement. following the directions is important because they ensure that all parties know exactly what documents are available and what the witnesses are going to say so that no one is taken by surprise. the tribunal may well disregard new evidence produced at or just before the hearing. a bundle of the documents and photographs to be considered at the hearing or paper determination will have to be prepared in all but the simplest cases. the directions will say how many copies of the bundle must be sent to the tribunal, and the date by which they must be sent, so that the tribunal members can read the documents and see what the issues are before the inspection, hearing or determination. the bundle must have a page index at the front and each subsequent page must be numbered in sequence so that, at the hearing, when a person refers to a document on a certain page, everyone will be able to turn to the document quickly. the tribunal will expect the parties to agree the bundle. if not, each party will have to prepare its own bundle and submit it separately with the numbering a (for applicant) 1, 2, 3 etc. and r (for respondent) 1, 2, 3 etc. on each page. the documents to include in the bundle will typically be copies of the application, any procedural directions, statements of case, any expert reports and witness statements, copies of the lease and any other relevant documents, for example invoices. sections with dividers are helpful and most bundles should be in a lever arch le or ring binder. no single bundle of papers should be more than 350 pages so more complex cases will need more than one lever arch le or ring binder. page 4 in some cases the directions may require the parties to set out the issues in dispute in a certain format. the most common format is referred to as a scott schedule . in a service charge dispute for example, the schedule might look something like this: item cost tenants comments landlords comments tenants reply agreed yes/no blank for tribunal 2013 cleaning 350 the cleaner was too expensive and i have a quote from someone who would do it cheaper. i would pay 250 the cleaner was recommended by residents and the cost is cheap compared to other commercial rms since the residents proposed the cleaner, i will agree the cleaning costs after all yes 2013 management fee 175 the agents do nothing. i would pay no more than 75 we attach a list of all the work we do in the year for leaseholders. our fee is reasonable i do not accept this work has been done nothe purpose of a scott schedule is to separate out the individual items in dispute and to give space for both parties to comment on those items, for example to say why the item is disputed, why it is or is not payable under the lease and how much would be a reasonable amount to pay. scott schedules work best when both parties have added their comments so that the tribunal can see the whole case in outline in one document. a well prepared schedule will often make the task of the parties and the tribunal at the hearing both easier and quicker. the hearing and decision in london, oral hearings are held at the london ofce. in other regions, the oral hearing can take place in a hearing room at the regional ofce but will often take place at a venue as near to the property as is practical. a party can speak for themselves or through a representative (whether professionally qualied or not). it is usually the applicants responsibility to present his or her case rst, but the tribunal chairman will provide guidance about the appropriate order of proceedings at the beginning of the hearing. each party will be able to put relevant questions to the other party. the members of the tribunal will try to put people at their ease and will also ask some questions. if anything is unclear during the hearing, parties are encouraged to ask the tribunal for clarication. the tribunals decision will be made after the hearing and sent to the parties in writing as soon as possible and usually within six weeks. page 5 expert witnessesin some cases, the evidence of an expert is needed either by a party or by the tribunal. if a party intends to instruct an expert to give evidence, the permission of the tribunal will have to be obtained. directions will then be given about the service of any experts report on other parties. if more than one party instructs experts of the same type, the chairman is likely to order them to discuss the case before the hearing to try to agree as much as they can and then produce a statement setting out what they agree and do not agree, with reasons. inspectionsthe tribunal may inspect the property if requested by either party or if the tribunal considers it necessary. a visit is considered necessary in most service charge cases, although if the tribunal is dealing with a number of similar properties at the same time, it may inspect a sample only. a visit will only take place on a date and at an approximate time notied to the parties. in some cases the tribunal might be assisted by inspecting the inside of a property as well as the outside and any common parts. the tribunal will only inspect inside a property if the occupiers permission has been given. the parties may also inspect the inside of the property with the tribunal, but again, only if the occupier has given permission. an inspection will usually be on the day of the hearing and is not a structural survey. at the inspection, either party can draw attention to any physical aspect of the property or its surroundings, but may not say anything further. for example, a damp patch on a wall can be pointed out, but any suggestion as to why it appeared should not be given. representations (arguments and evidence) will either have been made in writing already or will be made at the oral hearing if one has been requested. if the members of the tribunal are unable to gain access at the appointed time, they may decide to make another appointment or they may decide that they have sufcient information to go ahead and make a decision. variation and postponement applications parties may ask the tribunal to vary the directions or to postpone a listed hearing. all such requests must be made in writing to the tribunal with full reasons and must be copied to the other parties. the tribunal is unlikely to postpone a hearing unless there are good reasons which have arisen since the hearing date was xed. even good reasons will require some kind of evidence in order to prove that an expensive postponement is justied. page 6 withdrawalmost withdrawals are made by parties after a negotiated agreement. an applicant who wishes to withdraw all or part of their case must notify the tribunal and the other party in writing. if the other party has consented in writing, this must be included with the applicants notice to the tribunal. the applicants notice of withdrawal will not take effect until the tribunal consents to the withdrawal, and the tribunal may make directions or impose conditions on the withdrawal as it considers appropriate. consent orders if the parties come to an agreement as to the order they require, they may ask the tribunal to make a consent order . this would dispose of the proceedings and contain the other provisions which the parties have agreed. the tribunal may make a consent order if it considers it appropriate. the tribunal does not need to hold a hearing before making the order or provide reasons for the order. payment of fees if an application fee is payable the tribunal will not proceed further with the case until the fee is paid. if the case has not been started and the fee is not paid within 14 days of being payable the case will not be started. if a case has started, it will be deemed to be withdrawn 14 days after the applicant is notied that the fee remains unpaid. please note where there is to be a hearing, a fee of 200 will become payable when you receive notice of the hearing date. some applicants may have difculty paying a fee. a system of fee waivers and reductions, known as help with fees, is available. the application form ex160 apply for help with fees and ex160a guide - how to apply for help with fees gives more information. they are available online at www.gov.uk/government/publications/apply-for-help-with-court- and-tribunal-fees or from the local regional tribunal ofce. the form must accompany the application. alternatively, help with fees applications can be made online at www.gov.uk/ help-with-court-fees. the reference number supplied by the online system must be written on the tribunals application form. an applicant who paid a fee can ask the tribunal to order another party or parties to reimburse the applicant in whole or in part. the tribunal will make an order to that effect at the end of the case if it is fair to do so. page 7 mediationthe tribunal may, with the agreement of all parties and where suitable facilities are available, refer cases to a mediation service. a trained mediator works with the parties to resolve the dispute by agreement. in london, since 2005, full or partial agreement has been reached in a substantial majority of cases that have been referred to mediation. mediation can avoid many of the problems associated with a traditional adversarial hearing, not least cost, delay, potential publicity, stress and an unforeseen outcome. mediation does however require genuine commitment to compromise from all parties. costs the tribunal does not usually award costs against the losing side. however, if a party does not comply with the procedural directions or otherwise behaves unreasonably in connection with the proceedings, there could be serious consequences. firstly, the tribunal may decide to stop the application going ahead. secondly, if one party has incurred costs as a result of (a) another partys failure to comply with directions or (b) another partys unreasonable actions or behaviour, the tribunal may order the defaulting or unreasonable party to pay costs. parties should also check their lease for any liability to pay costs separately. some leases allow a landlord to include costs incurred in connection with proceedings before a tribunal as part of a service charge. section 20c of the landlord and tenant act 1985 gives the tribunal power, on application by a tenant, to make an order to the effect that such costs are not to be treated as relevant costs to be taken into account in determining the amount of any service charge payable by the tenant or any other person(s) specied in the application. following such an application, the tribunal will either refuse the request or make such order as it considers reasonable. special requirements the tribunal seeks to make itself as accessible as possible to all parties. if you have a particular requirement, for example, because of a disability or other need, please discuss this with the case ofcer when you make your application. use of emails the following rules are designed to minimise the impact that emails can have on the efcient running of the tribunal ofce. parties who wish to use emails are requested to: prepare a letter to the tribunal in word format and attach it to the email (maximum of ve pages - longer documents should be sent by post); as case ofcers are sometimes absent, always send or copy the email to the regional ofce email address; page 8 always copy any email to the other parties, either by email or by post, and conrm in the email/ letter that this has been done; always quote the reference number or case ofcers name in the email. email chains, email conversations about the case and bundles attached to emails will not be accepted. appeals and re-hearings in most cases where a party does not agree with the decision of the tribunal and wants it to be changed, an appeal will have to be made to the upper tribunal. in that case, the rst thing for that party to do is make an application to the tribunal for permission to appeal . the application for permission, which must be made within 28 days after the date when the written reasons for the decision were sent to the parties, must be in writing giving the reasons why the applicant believes the decision was wrong. the tribunal will then decide whether permission should be granted for the appeal to proceed. the parties will be notied of that decision in writing. a dissatised party will then be able to re-apply for permission direct to the upper tribunal. if the tribunal realises that a clerical mistake has been made it can issue a correction certicate .finally, if for a reason beyond the tribunals control, there has been a serious procedural error (for example, if the documents provided by one party were not seen by the tribunal) and the tribunal considers it to be in the interests of justice to do so, it can set aside its decision and re-determine the case. any application to set aside on this basis should be made within 28 days after the decision was sent to the parties. case closure if the issue or issues in the case have been referred from the county court, the tribunal decision and the case will be transferred back to the court. following either a withdrawal or determination of all applications (including any appeal), the tribunal will close its case le, which will be retained for a period of 12 months before being destroyed. what types of leasehold cases can the tribunal deal with?

t542-eng.txt,"tribunal members are appointed by the lord chancellor. there are two types of member: (a)the chairman , who will usually be a lawyer or surveyor, is responsible for the conduct of the case and writes the reasons for the tribunals decision; (b)other members who may be lawyers, surveyors, other professional people or lay people. when a tribunal is set up to consider the case, there will usually be two or three members including the chairman. case ofcers are the administrative staff who manage the process from start to nish and deal with correspondence. when an application is received, it is the case ofcer who will register the case and deal with the paperwork and correspondence until the parties have received the nal decision. the case ofcers are able to speak to parties

access at the appointed time, they may decide to make another appointment or they may decide that they have sufcient information to go ahead and make a decision. variation and postponement applications parties may ask the tribunal to vary the directions or to postpone a listed hearing. all such requests must be made in writing to the tribunal with full reasons and must be copied to the other parties. the tribunal is unlikely to postpone a hearing unless there are good reasons which have arisen since the hearing date was xed. even good reasons will require some kind of evidence in order to prove that an expensive postponement is justied. withdrawalsmost withdrawals are made by parties after a negotiated agreement. an applicant who wishes to withdraw all or part of their case must notify the tribunal and the other party in writing. if the other party has consented in writing, this must be included with the applicants notice to the tribunal. the applicants notice of withdrawal will not take effect until the tribunal consents to the withdrawal, and the tribunal may make directions or impose conditions on the withdrawal as it considers appropriate. consent orders if the parties come to an agreement as to the order they require, they may ask the tribunal to make a consent order . this would dispose of the proceedings and contain the other provisions which the parties have agreed. the tribunal may make a consent order if it considers it appropriate. the tribunal does not need to hold a hearing before making the order or provide reasons for the order. payment of fees if an application fee is payable the tribunal will not proceed further with the case until the fee is paid. if the case has not been started and the fee is not paid within 14 days of being payable the case will not be started. if a case has started, it will be deemed to be withdrawn 14 days after the applicant is notied that the fee remains unpaid. page 6 please note where there is to be a hearing, a fee of 200 will become payable when you receive notice of the hearing date. some applicants may have difculty paying a fee. a system of fee waivers and reductions, known as help with fees, is available. the application form ex160 apply for help with fees and ex160a guide - how to apply for help with fees gives more information. they are available online at www.gov.uk/government/publications/apply-for-help-with-court- and-tribunal-fees or from the local regional tribunal ofce. the form must accompany the application. alternatively, help with fees applications can be made online at www.gov.uk/ help-with-court-fees. the reference number supplied by the online system must be written on the tribunals application form. an applicant who paid a fee can ask the tribunal to order another party or parties to reimburse the applicant in whole or in part. the tribunal will make an order to that effect at the end of the case if it is fair to do so. costs the tribunal does not usually award costs against the losing side. however, if a party does not comply with the procedural directions or otherwise behaves unreasonably in connection with the proceedings, there could be serious consequences. firstly, the tribunal may decide to stop the application going ahead. secondly, if one party has incurred costs as a result of (a) another partys failure to comply with directions or (b) another partys unreasonable actions or behaviour, the tribunal may order the defaulting or unreasonable party to pay costs. special requirements the tribunal seeks to make itself as accessible as possible to all parties. if you have a particular requirement, for example because of a disability or other need, please discuss this with the case ofcer when you make your application. use of emails the following rules are designed to minimise the impact that emails can have on the efcient running of the tribunal ofce. parties who wish to use emails are requested to: prepare a letter to the tribunal in word format and attach it to the email (maximum of ve pages - longer documents should be sent by post); as case ofcers are sometimes absent, always send or copy the email to the regional ofce email address; always copy any email to the other parties, either by email or by post, and conrm in the email/ letter that this has been done; always quote the reference number or case ofcers name in the email. page 7 email chains, email conversations about the case and bundles attached to emails will not be accepted. appeals and re-hearings in most cases where a party does not agree with the decision of the tribunal and wants it to be changed, an appeal will have to be made to the upper tribunal. in that case, the rst thing for that party to do is make an application to the tribunal for permission to appeal . the application for permission, which must be made within 28 days after the date when the written reasons for the decision were sent to the parties, must be in writing giving the reasons why the applicant believes the decision was wrong. the tribunal will then decide whether permission should be granted for the appeal to proceed. the parties will be notied of that decision in writing. a dissatised party will then be able to re-apply for permission direct to the upper tribunal. if the tribunal realises that a clerical mistake has been made it can issue a correction certicate. finally, if for a reason beyond the tribunals control, there has been a serious procedural error (for example, if the documents provided by one party were not seen by the tribunal) and the tribunal considers it to be in the interests of justice to do so, it can set aside its decision and re-determine the case. any application to set aside on this basis should be made within 28 days after the reasoned decision was sent to the parties. case closure following either a withdrawal or determination of all applications (including any appeal), the tribunal will close its case le, which will be retained for a period of 12 months before being destroyed. what types of application can be made in housing act 2004 and housing and planning act 2016

t544-eng.txt,"tribunal members are appointed by the lord chancellor. there are two types of member: (a)the chairman, who will usually be a lawyer or surveyor, is responsible for the conduct of the case and writes the reasons for the tribunals decision; (b)other members who may be lawyers, surveyors, other professional people or lay people. page 2 when a tribunal is set up to consider the case, there will usually be two or three members including the chairman. case ofcers are the administrative staff who manage the process end-to-end and deal with correspondence. when an application is received, it is the case ofcer who will register the case and deal with the paperwork and correspondence until the parties have received the nal decision. the case ofcers are able to speak to parties about the procedures relating to the application, but they cannot give legal advice or interpret the tribunals decision. applicationsan application form must be completed by the applicant in all cases. forms can be obtained from to www.gov.uk/housing-tribunals/apply-to-the-tribunal, or if you do not have access to a computer, you can ask a case ofcer to send you a form. the forms have been carefully designed to ensure that we have all the initial information we need. some applications involve the payment of a fee. fees information is contained in our application forms. once an application is received, it will be checked by a case ofcer for completeness and the applicant will be sent an acknowledgement. a copy will be sent to the other party (the respondent) and any person whose name and address is known to the tribunal whom the tribunal considers is likely to be signicantly affected by the application. a copy will also be sent to any person to whom the owner proposes to sell or gift the home under the act. a copy may also be sent to any other person the tribunal considers appropriate. when many respondents are named by an applicant, the case ofcer might ask the applicant either to provide sufcient copies and stamped addressed envelopes for this purpose or to send the documents direct to those persons on behalf of the tribunal. upon receipt of an application, the tribunal assesses the urgency and complexity of the case. in urgent cases, such as where the health, safety and welfare of people may be of concern, a hearing can be listed within days. in relatively simple cases, the parties may request, or the tribunal may suggest, that the case can be dealt with by considering the written evidence and the parties written representations only (without the need for an oral hearing ). this is referred to as a paper determination . however, any party, who wishes also has the right to request a hearing. case preparation in cases where the issues are not clear, there may be an oral case management conference (cmc) which provides an opportunity for the parties to make concessions and narrow the issues between them. if a cmc is arranged, parties are encouraged to attend. the cmc is a good opportunity for parties to have their say about what directions (see below) should be given in the case and to ask questions about the procedure that should be followed by the parties. page 3 in cases where the issues can be readily identied, a tribunal chairman will issue written procedural directions requesting particular actions from one or both parties before the hearing. the procedural directions document will sometimes set out what the issues are and say when the parties need to send each other copies of documents. it will say whether there is to be an inspection of the park home and site and may give an estimate of the length of the nal hearing. if a party or another person is going to say something to the tribunal, he or she may be required to prepare a witness statement. following the directions is important because they ensure that all parties know exactly what documents are available and what the witnesses are going to say so that no one is taken by surprise. the tribunal may well disregard new evidence produced at or just before the hearing. a bundle of the documents and photographs to be considered at the hearing or paper determination will have to be prepared in all but the simplest cases. the directions will say how many copies of the bundle must be sent to the tribunal, and the date by which they must be sent, so that the tribunal members can read the documents and see what the issues are before the inspection, hearing or determination. the bundle must have a page index at the front and each subsequent page must be numbered in sequence so that, at the hearing, when a person refers to a document on a certain page, everyone will be able to turn to the document quickly. the tribunal will expect the parties to agree the bundle. if not, each party will have to prepare its own bundle and submit it separately with the numbering a (for applicant) 1, 2, 3 etc. and r (for respondent) 1, 2, 3 etc. on each page. the documents to include in the bundle will typically be copies of the application, any procedural directions, statements of case, any expert reports and witness statements, copies of the occupation agreement and any other relevant documents, for example invoices. sections with dividers are helpful and most bundles should be in a lever arch le or ring binder. no single bundle of papers should be more than 350 pages so more complex cases will need more than one lever arch le or ring binder. the hearing and decision in london, oral hearings are held at the london ofce. in other regions, the oral hearing can take place in a hearing room at the regional ofce but will often take place at a venue as near to the property as is practical. a party can speak for themselves or through a representative (whether professionally qualied or not). it is usually the applicants responsibility to present his or her case rst, but the tribunal chairman will provide guidance about the appropriate order of proceedings at the beginning of the hearing. each party will be able to put relevant questions to the other party. the members of the tribunal will try to put people at their ease and will also ask page 4 some questions. if anything is unclear during the hearing, parties are encouraged to ask the tribunal for clarication. the tribunals decision will be made after the hearing and sent to the parties in writing as soon as possible and usually within four weeks. expert witnessesin some cases, the evidence of an expert is needed either by a party or by the tribunal. if a party intends to instruct an expert to give evidence, the permission of the tribunal will have to be obtained. directions will then be given about the service of any experts report on other parties. if more than one party instructs experts of the same type, the chairman is likely to order them to discuss the case before the hearing to try to agree as much as they can and then produce a statement setting out what they agree and do not agree, with reasons. inspectionsthe tribunal may inspect the park home and site if requested by either party or if the tribunal considers it necessary. a visit will only take place on a date and at an approximate time notied to the parties. in some cases the tribunal might be assisted by inspecting the inside of the park home as well as the outside and the site. the tribunal will only inspect inside the home if the occupiers permission has been given. the parties may also inspect the inside of the home with the tribunal, but again, only if the occupier has given permission. an inspection will usually be on the day of the hearing. at the inspection, either party can draw attention to any physical aspect of the park home or its surroundings, but may not say anything further. for example, a rusting base can be pointed out, but any suggestion as to why that occurred should not be given. representations (arguments and evidence) will either have been made in writing already or will be made at the oral hearing if one has been requested. if the members of the tribunal are unable to gain access at the appointed time, they may decide to make another appointment or they may decide that they have sufcient information to go ahead and make a decision. variation and postponement applications parties may ask the tribunal to vary the directions or to

tenants association a recognised tenants association is an association of qualifying tenants of dwellings (whether with or without other tenants) which is recognised for the purposes of the service charge provisions of the landlord and tenant act 1985. recognition is either by a notice in writing given by the landlord to the secretary of the association or by a certicate granted by the tribunal. a number of tenants are qualifying tenants if each of them may be required, under the terms of his or her lease, to contribute to the same costs by way of a service charge. the service charge must be one which varies or may vary in whole or in part according to changes in the costs. there is no statutory specication of the matters to which the tribunal is to give regard in giving or cancelling a certicate of recognition and each application will be considered on its merits. in practice the tribunal will want to be satised that the constitution and rules of the association are fair and democratic and that it is independent of the landlord and, in the case of a company landlord, its employees. the tribunal will be concerned to see that the actual paid up membership of the association represents a substantial proportion (as a general rule not less than 60%) of the potential membership. a certicate will usually be granted for a xed period (usually for four years) and application can be made for its renewal. a certicate may be cancelled if the tribunal considers that for some reason the association no longer merits recognition. applicationsan application form must be completed by the applicant in almost all cases. forms can be obtained from www.gov.uk/housing-tribunals/apply-to-the-tribunal, or if you do not have access to a computer, you can ask a case ofcer to send you a

once the tribunals decision is made it will be sent to the parties in writing with reasons for the decision. page 3 case preparation in cases where the issues are clearly identied, a tribunal chairman

liability to pay costs separately. some leases allow a landlord to include costs incurred in connection with proceedings before a tribunal as part of a service charge. section 20c of the landlord and tenant act 1985 gives the tribunal power, on application by a tenant, to make an order to the effect that such costs are not to be treated as relevant costs to be taken into account in determining the amount of any service charge payable by the tenant or any other person(s) specied in the application. following such an application, the tribunal will either refuse the request or make such order as

it will be checked by a case ofcer for completeness and the applicant will be sent an acknowledgement. a copy will be sent to the other party (the respondent). in relatively simple cases, the parties may request, or the tribunal may suggest, that the case can be dealt with by considering the written evidence and the parties written representations only (without the need for an oral hearing). this is referred to as a paper determination . however, any party who so wishes has the right to request a hearing. case preparation in cases where the issues can be readily identied, a tribunal chairman will issue written procedural directions requesting particular actions from one or both parties before the hearing. the procedural directions document will sometimes set out what the issues are and say when the parties need to send each other copies of documents. it will say whether there is to be an inspection of the property and may give an estimate of the length of the hearing. if a party or another person is going to say something to the tribunal, he or she may be required to prepare a witness statement. following the directions is important because they ensure that all parties know exactly what documents are available and what the witnesses are going to say so that no one is taken by surprise. the tribunal may well disregard new evidence produced at or just before the hearing. the hearing and decision in london, oral hearings are held at the london ofce. in other regions, the oral hearing can take place in a hearing room at the regional ofce but will often take place at a venue as near to the property as is practical. in special cases the venue may be the property itself. page 3 a party can speak for themselves or through a representative (whether professionally qualied or not). it is usually the applicants responsibility to present his or her case rst, but the tribunal chairman will provide guidance about the appropriate order of proceedings at the beginning of the hearing. each party will be able to put relevant questions to the other party. the members of the tribunal will try to put people at their ease and will also ask some questions. if anything is unclear during the hearing, parties are encouraged to ask the tribunal for clarication. the tribunals decision will be made after the hearing and sent to the parties in writing as soon as possible and usually within four weeks. inspectionsthe tribunal may inspect the property if requested by either party or if the tribunal considers it necessary. an inspection is considered necessary in most cases. a visit will only take place on a date and at an approximate time notied to the parties. in most cases the tribunal will be assisted by inspecting the inside of a property as well as the outside and any common parts. the tribunal will only inspect inside a property if the occupiers permission has been given. the parties may also inspect the inside of the property with the tribunal, but again, only if the occupier has given permission. an inspection will usually be on the day of the hearing and is not a structural survey. at the inspection, either party can draw attention to any physical aspect of the property or its surroundings, but may not say anything further. representations (arguments and evidence) will either have been made in writing already or will be made at the oral hearing if one has been requested. if the members of the tribunal are unable to gain access at the appointed time, they may decide to make another appointment or they may decide that they have sufcient information to go ahead and make a decision. variation and postponement applications parties may ask the tribunal to vary the directions or to postpone a listed hearing. all such requests must be made in writing to the tribunal with full reasons and must be copied to the other parties. the tribunal is unlikely to postpone a hearing unless there are good reasons which have arisen since the hearing date was xed. even good reasons will require some kind of evidence in order to prove that an expensive postponement is justied. withdrawalmost withdrawals are made by parties after a negotiated agreement. an applicant who wishes to withdraw all or part of their case must notify the tribunal and the other party in writing. if the other party has consented in writing, this must be included with the page 4 applicants notice to the tribunal. the applicants notice of withdrawal will not take effect until the tribunal consents to the withdrawal, and the tribunal may make directions or impose conditions on the withdrawal as it considers appropriate. costs the tribunal does not usually award costs against the losing side. however, if a party does not comply with the procedural directions or otherwise behaves unreasonably in connection with the proceedings, there could be serious consequences. firstly, the tribunal may decide to stop the application going ahead and secondly, if one party has incurred costs as a result of (a) another partys failure to comply with directions or (b) another partys unreasonable actions or behaviour, the tribunal may order the defaulting or unreasonable party to pay costs. consent orders if the parties come to an agreement as to the order they require, they may ask the tribunal to make a consent order . this would dispose of the proceedings and contain the other provisions which the parties have agreed. the tribunal may make a consent order if it considers it appropriate. the tribunal does not need to hold a hearing before making the order or provide reasons for the order. payment of fees if an application fee is payable the tribunal will not proceed further with the case until the fee is paid. if the case has not been started and the fee is not paid within 14 days of being payable the case will not be started. if a case has started, it will be deemed to be withdrawn 14 days after the applicant is notied that the fee remains unpaid. please note where there is to be a hearing, a fee of 200 will become payable when you receive notice of the hearing date. some applicants may have difculty paying a fee. a system of fee waivers and reductions, known as help with fees, is available. the application form ex160 apply for help with fees and ex160a guide - how to apply for help with fees gives more information. they are available online at www.gov.uk/government/publications/apply-for-help-with-court- and-tribunal-fees or from the local regional tribunal ofce. the form must accompany the application. alternatively, help with fees applications can be made online at www.gov.uk/ help-with-court-fees. the reference number supplied by the online system must be written on the tribunals application form. an applicant who paid a fee can ask the tribunal to order another party or parties to reimburse the applicant in whole or in part. the tribunal will make an order to that effect at the end of the case if it is fair to do so. page 5 special requirements the tribunal seeks to make itself as accessible as possible to all parties. if you have a particular requirement, for example because of a disability or other need, please discuss this with the case ofcer when you make your application. use of emails the following rules are designed to minimise the impact that emails can have on the efcient running of the tribunal ofce. parties who wish to use emails are requested to: prepare a letter to the tribunal in word format and attach it to the email (maximum of ve pages - longer documents should be sent by post); as case ofcers are sometimes absent, always send or copy the email to the regional ofce email address; always copy any email to the other parties, either by email or by post, and conrm in the email/ letter that this has been done; always quote the reference number or case ofcers name in the email. email chains, email conversations about the case and bundles attached to emails will not be accepted. appeals and re-hearings in most cases where a party does not agree with the decision of the tribunal and wants it to be changed, an appeal will have to be made to the upper tribunal. in that case, the rst thing for that party to do is make an application to the tribunal for permission to appeal . the application for permission, which must be made within 28 days after the date when the written reasons for the decision were sent to the parties, must be in writing giving the reasons why the applicant believes the decision was wrong. the tribunal will then decide whether permission should be granted for the appeal to proceed. the parties will be notied of that decision in writing. a dissatised party will then be able to re-apply for permission direct to the upper tribunal. if the tribunal realises that a clerical mistake has been made it can issue a correction certicate .finally, if for a reason beyond the tribunals control, there has been a serious procedural error (e.g. if the documents provided by one party were not seen by the tribunal) and the tribunal considers it to be in the interests of justice to do so, it can set aside its decision and re- determine the case. any application to set aside on this basis should be made within 28 days after the decision was sent to the parties. page 6 case closure following either a withdrawal or determination of all applications (including any appeal), the tribunal will close its case le, which will be retained for a period of 12 months before being destroyed. tribunal website:

of the office letter sending you the upper tribunal decision. you should give your reasons. how to appeal to the court of appeal or court of session against an upper tribunal decision there is a right of appeal to the court of appeal (england and wales) or court of session (scotland) against the decision of an upper tribunal judge if it is wrong in law. you must have permission from the upper tribunal, or if the upper tribunal refuses, from the court. an application for permission to appeal to the court of appeal must be received by the upper tribunal within one month of the latest of- written notice of the decision being sent to you, or of your being notified of amended reasons for, or a correction of, the decision following review (see below), or of your being notified that an application to set aside (made in time or with an extension of time) has not been successful. the time limit may be extended by the upper tribunal judge. you must make your application in writing identifying the alleged error or errors of law and stating the result you ask for. how the upper tribunal considers your application for permission to appeal on an application for permission to appeal, the upper tribunal may review the decision and may set it aside, amend the reasons for it or correct it if- when making the decision the judge overlooked a legislative provision or binding authority which could have had a material effect on the decision, or since the decision a higher court has made another decision binding on the upper tribunal which, if made before the decision, could have had a material effect on it. the upper tribunal must notify the parties in writing of the outcome of any review. if the upper tribunal takes any action on review without first giving every party an opportunity to make representations it must allow that party to apply for the action to be set aside and the decision to be reviewed again. if the upper tribunal does not review, or on review decides not to alter the decision, it must decide whether to grant permission to appeal to the court of appeal. it must record the decision in writing and give reasons for refusing permission. it can give permission in respect of only some of the grounds put forward, but if so, must give reasons for its refusal of the other grounds. if you are refused permission to appeal by the upper tribunal you may renew your application in the court of appeal (england and wales) or court of session (scotland). if the upper tribunal grants you permission you will need to appeal to the court of appeal/ court of session. appeal time limits are short so if you wish to renew your application or to appeal you should contact the appeals office as soon as possible. the addresses for the court of appeal is: the

administrative justice and tribunals council the administrative justice and tribunals council has certain supervisory responsibilities with regard to many tribunals, including the upper tribunal. their address is: administrative justice and tribunals council, 81 chancery lane, london, wc2a 1bq, tel: 020 7855 5200 10 the meaning of words the following words are either used in this leaflet or may be used in documents you receive from the office of the administrative appeals chamber of the upper tribunal. an appeal is made by a person or company. an appellant is the person, or other body, who is appealing. the court of appeal in london is a higher court (for cases in england and wales) to which you may be able to appeal against an upper tribunal decision. the court of session in edinburgh is a higher court (for cases in scotland) to which you may be able to appeal against an upper tribunal decision. a direction is a written instruction by the upper tribunal judge, or a registrar, on the procedure that must be followed. the judge will make a direction at the beginning of an appeal as to the order in which the parties are to make their submissions and the time limits for doing so. oral hearings are described in the section titled procedure at the hearing. permission to appeal is the first essential step in the onward appeals process (i.e. to the court of appeal/ court of session). if you do not have permission you will not be able to appeal. a point of law, error of law and wrong in law: examples are o the tribunal did not apply the correct law or wrongly interpreted the law. o the tribunal made a procedural error. o the tribunal had no evidence, or not enough evidence, to support its decision. o the tribunal did not give adequate reasons for its decision in the written statement of its reasons. these are only examples and the tribunal may be wrong in law for some other reason not mentioned here. if you are uncertain you may like to seek advice as described in that section. a procedural error is something that has gone wrong with the procedure in an appeal. the procedural rules in relation to appeals to the upper tribunal are set out in the upper tribunal rules. however, only certain limited errors give you the right to have a decision set aside. a registrar is a barrister or solicitor who works in the upper tribunal and who is
